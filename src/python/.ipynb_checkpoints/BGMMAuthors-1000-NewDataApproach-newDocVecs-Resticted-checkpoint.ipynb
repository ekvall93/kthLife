Using this framework, where deposited energies differ from actual photon energies, we compare the performance of a silicon strip detector, including the influence of scatter inside the detector and charge sharing but disregarding signal pileup, with an ideal energy integrating detector. We show that although the detection efficiency for silicon rapidly drops for the acceleration voltages encountered in clinical computed tomography practice, silicon detectors could perform on a par with ideal energy integrating detectors for routine imaging tasks. The use of spectrally sensitive detectors opens up the possibility for decomposition techniques such as k-edge imaging, and we show that the proposed modification of the spectral imaging framework is beneficial for such imaging tasks.']\n",

      "['We are developing a photon-counting silicon strip detector with 0.4 x 0.5 mm(2) detector elements for clinical CT applications. Except for the limited detection efficiency of approximately 0.8 for a spectrum of 80 kVp, the largest discrepancies from ideal spectral behaviour have been shown to be Compton interactions in the detector and electronic noise. Using the framework of cascaded system analysis, we reconstruct the 3D MTF and NPS of a silicon strip detector including the influence of scatter and charge sharing inside the detector. We compare the reconstructed noise and signal characteristics with a reconstructed 3D MTF and NPS of an ideal energy-integrating detector system with unity detection efficiency, no scatter or charge sharing inside the detector, unity presampling MTF and 1 x 1 mm(2) detector elements. The comparison is done by calculating the dose-normalized detectability index for some clinically relevant imaging tasks and spectra. This work demonstrates that although the detection efficiency of the silicon detector rapidly drops for the acceleration voltages encountered in clinical computed tomography practice, and despite the high fraction of Compton interactions due to the low atomic number, silicon detectors can perform on a par with ideal energy-integrating detectors for routine imaging tasks containing low-frequency components. For imaging tasks containing high-frequency components, the proposed silicon detector system can perform approximately 1.1-1.3 times better than a fully ideal energy-integrating system.']\n",

      "['There is an increasing interest in the development of thin, flexible energy storage devices for new applications. For large scale and low cost devices, structures with the use of earth abundant materials are attractive. In this study, we fabricated flexible and conductive nanopaper aerogels with incorporated carbon nanotubes (CNT). Such conductive nanopaper is made from aqueous dispersions with dispersed CNT and cellulose nanofibers. Such aerogels are highly porous with open channels that allow the deposition of a thin-layer of silicon through a plasma-enhanced CVD (PECVD) method. Meanwhile, the open channels also allow for an excellent ion accessibility to the surface of silicon. We demonstrated that such lightweight and flexible Si-conductive nanopaper structure performs well as Li-ion battery anodes. A stable capacity of 1200. mA. h/g for 100 cycles in half-cells is achieved. Such flexible anodes based on earth abundant materials and aqueous dispersions could potentially open new opportunities for low-cost energy devices, and potentially can be applied for large-scale energy storage.']\n",

      "[\"Visualizing individual molecules with chemical recognition is a longstanding target in catalysis, molecular nanotechnology and biotechnology. Molecular vibrations provide a valuable 'finger-print' for such identification. Vibrational spectroscopy based on tip-enhanced Raman scattering allows us to access the spectral signals of molecular species very efficiently via the strong localized plasmonic fields produced at the tip apex(1-11). However, the best spatial resolution of the tip-enhanced Raman scattering imaging is still limited to 3-15 nanometres(5,12-16), which is not adequate for resolving a single molecule chemically. Here we demonstrate Raman spectral imaging with spatial resolution below one nanometre, resolving the inner structure and surface configuration of a single molecule. This is achieved by spectrally matching the resonance of the nanocavity plasmon to the molecular vibronic transitions, particularly the downward transition responsible for the emission of Raman photons. This matching is made possible by the extremely precise tuning capability provided by scanning tunnelling microscopy. Experimental evidence suggests that the highly confined and broadband nature of the nanocavity plasmon field in the tunnelling gap is essential for ultrahigh-resolution imaging through the generation of an efficient double-resonance enhancement for both Raman excitation and Raman emission. Our technique not only allows for chemical imaging at the single-molecule level, but also offers a new way to study the optical processes and photochemistry of a single molecule.\"]\n",

LC is unidirectionally aligned via surface-treatment, and then gets GNRs organized with a negative order parameter in bulk through elastic force. The self-assembled GNRs (with a considerable high concentration of about 6 wt%) in LC exhibit a strong polarization-dependent localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). Polarized optical microscopic imaging, polarization-dependent extinction and scattering spectra of LSPR are utilized to characterize the spatial orientation of GNRs.

The reason is obvious: if the product is not appreciated by consumers they will search for another alternative which will decrease the estimated market share for a specific residential project. The main idea in this study is to increase our understanding of how to design and build more attractive residential developments by evaluating buyers' needs and preferences. Research concerning the means-end chain theory and the laddering technique has been quite extensive in the food industry but examples in residential development are rare. Laddering interviews were made with respondents who visited open house sales of a tenant-owned apartment on sale. We hypothesize that there exists a difference between bidders and non-bidders regarding their beliefs of functional and psychological consequences and abstract personal values. In our study we did not find any major difference in terminal values, but instrumental values do differ. This is true also for abstract product attributes and functional and psychological consequences. Professional developers and planners were able to use the beliefs of bidders and non-bidders to decide on a re-design of specific locations in the residential development of Frosunda, north of Stockholm, Sweden.\"]\n",

The trend of today is to use a turbocharger with high boost level. For SI-engines a regular WG turbocharger has been used, but in the future, when the boost level increases together with higher demand on the transient response, a Variable Nozzle Turbine (VNT) will be used together with Variable Valve Timing (VVT). As the degree of freedom increases, the control strategies during a transient load step will be more difficult to develop. A 1D simulation experiment has been conducted in GT Power where the transient simulation was \"frozen\" at certain time steps. The data from these time steps was put in a stationary simulation and the excessive energy was then bled off to obtain the same conditions for the engine in the stationary simulation as if the engine where in the middle of the transient. This method allows a faster and easier way to obtain a good control strategy for the VNT turbine and the VVT during a transient load step.

With inspiration from a project involving four major Swedish media companies experiencing an increasing need for business travel and decreasing resources, this study assessed the potential greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and cumulative energy demand (CED) related to different types of business meetings, using a life cycle perspective. The potential consequences for emissions of GHG and CED in two hypothetical companies introducing mediated meetings were also assessed. The results indicated that mediated meetings using personal computers can reduce GHG emissions and CED per meeting and that more advanced mediated solutions are preferable to meetings which require travel, if the equipment is frequently used to replace travel. However, advanced technology that is under-used may give similar or higher GHG emissions and CED than meetings traveled to by train. All mediated meeting alternatives studied here had lower GHG emissions and CED than meetings which required travel by plane or car. LCD screen manufacture contributed the main environmental impact of mediated meetings, but the meeting rooms needed, electricity use for equipment and internet use for data transmission were also important in some cases. As LCD screen manufacture and internet energy use were main issues and as the data on these issues are uncertain, they should be further assessed+ and updated in future studies.

The major advantage of group-based control is its capability in providing flexible phase structures. The current group-based control systems are usually implemented with rather simple timing logics, e.g. vehicle actuated logic. However, such a timing logic is not sufficient to respond to the traffic environment whose inputs, i.e. traffic demands, dynamically change over time. Therefore, the primary objective of this paper is to formulate the existing group-based signal controller as a multi-agent system. The proposed signal control system is capable of making intelligent timing decisions by utilizing machine learning techniques. In this regard, reinforcement learning is a potential solution because of its self-learning properties in a dynamic environment. This paper, thus, proposes an adaptive signal control system, enabled by a reinforcement learning algorithm, in the context of group-based phasing technique. Two different learning algorithms, Q-learning and SARSA, have been investigated and tested on a four-legged intersection. The experiments are carried out by means of an open-source traffic simulation tool, SUMO. Performances on traffic mobility of the adaptive group- based signal control systems are compared against those of a well-established group-based fixed time control system. In the testbed experiments, simulation results reveal that the learning-based adaptive signal controller outperforms group-based fixed time signal controller with regards to the improvements in traffic mobility efficiency.

      "['Group-based control is an advanced traffic signal strategy capable of dynamically generating phase sequences at intersections. Combined with the phasing scheme, vehicle actuated timing is often adopted to respond to the detected traffic. However, the parameters of a signal controller are often predetermined in practice, and the control performance may suffer from deterioration when dealing with highly fluctuating traffic demand. This study proposes a group-based signal control approach capable of making decisions based on its understanding of traffic conditions at the intersection level. In particular, the control problem is formulated using a framework of stochastic optimal control for multi-agent system in which each signal group is modeled as an intelligent agent. The agents learn how to react to traffic environment and make optimal timing decisions according to the perceived system states. Reinforcement learning, enhanced by multiple-step backups, is employed as the kernel of the intelligent control algorithm, where each agent updates its knowledge on-line based on a sequence of states during the process. In addition, the proposed system is designated to be compatible with the prevailing signal system. A case study was carried out in a simulation environment to compare the proposed control approach with a benchmark controller used in practice, group-based vehicle actuated (GBVA) controller, whose parameters were off-line optimized using a genetic algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed adaptive group-based control system outperforms the optimized GBVA control system mainly because of its real-time adaptive learning capacity in response to the changes in traffic demand.']\n",

      "['Self-triggered sampling is an attractive paradigm for closed-loop control over energy-constrained wireless sensor networks (WSNs) because it may give substantial communication savings. The understanding of the performance of self-triggered control systems when the feedback loops are closed over IEEE 802.15.4 WSNs is of major interest, since the communication standard IEEE 802.15.4 is the de-facto reference protocol for energy-efficient WSNs. In this paper, a new approach to control several processes over a shared IEEE 802.15.4 network by self-triggered sampling is proposed. It is shown that the sampling time of the processes, the protocol parameters, and the scheduling of the transmissions must be jointly selected to achieve a good performance of the closed-loop system and an energy-efficient utilization of the network. The challenging part of the proposed analysis is ensuring globally uniformly ultimately boundedness of the controlled processes while providing efficient scheduling of the process state transmissions. Such a scheduling is difficult when asynchronous multiple control loops share the network, because transmissions over IEEE 802.15.4 are allowed only at certain time slots. The proposed approach establishes that the joint design of self-triggered samplers and the network protocol (1) ensures globally uniformly ultimately boundedness of each control loop, (2) reduces the number of sensor transmissions, and (3) increases the sleep time of the transmitting nodes. A new dynamic scheduling problem is proposed for the joint control of each process and network protocol adaptation. An algorithm is derived, which adapts the network parameters according to the self-triggered sampler of every control loop. Numerical examples illustrate the analysis and show the benefits of the approach. It is concluded that self-triggered control strategies over WSNs ensure desired control performance, reduce the network utilization, and reduce energy consumption only if the protocol parameters are appropriately regulated.']\n",

Meanwhile, for the capability of providing multi-gigabits per second (Gbps) rates, millimeter-wave (mm-wave) communication has attracted substantial research interest recently. This paper investigates two strategies to reduce the communication delay in future wireless networks: traffic dispersion and network densification. A hybrid scheme that combines these two strategies is also considered. The probabilistic delay and effective capacity are used to evaluate performance. For probabilistic delay, the violation probability of delay, i.e., the probability that the delay exceeds a given tolerance level, is characterized in terms of upper bounds, which are derived by applying stochastic network calculus theory. In addition, to characterize the maximum affordable arrival traffic for mmwave systems, the effective capacity, i.e., the service capability with a given quality-of-service (QoS) requirement, is studied. The derived bounds on the probabilistic delay and effective capacity are validated through simulations. These numerical results show that, for a given sum power budget, traffic dispersion, network densification, and the hybrid scheme exhibit different potentials to reduce the end-to-end communication delay. For instance, traffic dispersion outperforms network densification when high sum power budget and arrival rate are given, while it could be the worst option, otherwise. Furthermore, it is revealed that, increasing the number of independent paths and/or relay density is always beneficial, while the performance gain is related to the arrival rate and sum power, jointly. Therefore, a proper transmission scheme should be selected to optimize the delay performance, according to the given conditions on arrival traffic and system service capability.']\n",

Consequently the details of, for example, cellular protein distributions, can be visualized only to a certain extent. Fortunately, recent years have witnessed the development of 'super-resolution' farfield optical microscopy (nanoscopy) techniques such as stimulated emission depletion (STED), ground state depletion (GSD), reversible saturated optical (fluorescence) transitions (RESOLFT), photoactivation localization microscopy (PALM), stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), structured illumination microscopy (SIM) or saturated structured illumination microscopy (SSIM), all in one way or another addressing the problem of the limited spatial resolution of far-field optical microscopy. While SIM achieves a two-fold improvement in spatial resolution compared to conventional optical microscopy, STED, RESOLFT, PALM/STORM, or SSIM have all gone beyond, pushing the limits of optical image resolution to the nanometer scale.

      "[\"The molecular mechanism(s) of action of anesthetic, and especially, intoxicating doses of alcohol (ethanol [EtOH]) have been of interest even before the advent of the Research Society on Alcoholism. Recent physiological, genetic, and biochemical studies have pin-pointed molecular targets for anesthetics and EtOH in the brain as ligand-gated ion channel (LGIC) membrane proteins, especially the pentameric (5 subunit) Cys-loop superfamily of neurotransmitter receptors including nicotinic acetylcholine (nAChRs), GABA(A) (GABA(A)Rs), and glycine receptors (GlyRs). The ability to demonstrate molecular and structural elements of these proteins critical for the behavioral effects of these drugs on animals and humans provides convincing evidence for their role in the drugs' actions. Amino acid residues necessary for pharmacologically relevant allosteric modulation of LGIC function by anesthetics and EtOH have been identified in these channel proteins. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed potential allosteric modulatory sites in both the trans-membrane domain (TMD) and extracellular domain (ECD). Potential sites of action and binding have been deduced from homology modeling of other LGICs with structures known from crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy studies. Direct information about ligand binding in the TMD has been obtained by photoaffinity labeling, especially in GABA(A)Rs. Recent structural information from crystallized procaryotic (ELIC and GLIC) and eukaryotic (GluCl) LGICs allows refinement of the structural models including evaluation of possible sites of EtOH action.\"]\n",

      "['In the present work, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION) surface-coated with 3-merca-ptopropanoic acid (3-MPA) were prepared and their feasibility for the removal of arsenate from dilute aqueous solutions was demonstrated. The synthesized 3-MPA-coated SPION was characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Fourier transform infra-red spectrometry (FTIR). Separation efficiency of the coated nanoparticles and the equilibrium isotherm of arsenate adsorption were investigated. The obtained results reveal the arsenate adsorption to be highly pH-dependent, and the maximum adsorption was attained in less than 60 min. The resulting increase of 3-MPA-coated SPION adsorption capacity to twice the adsorption capacity of SPION alone under the same conditions is attributed to the increase of active adsorption sites. An adsorption reaction is proposed. On the other hand, efficient recovery of arsenate from the loaded nanoparticles was achieved using nitric acid (HNO3) solution, which also provides a concentration over the original arsenate solution.']\n",

A single model that could describe the variations in metabolic behavior triggered by variations in the culture conditions would be a precious tool in bioprocess development. In this paper, we introduce an approach to generate a poly-pathway model and use it to simulate diverse metabolic states triggered in response to removal, reduction or doubling of amino acids in the culture medium of an antibody-producing CHO cell line. Macro-reactions were obtained from a metabolic network via elementary flux mode enumeration and the fluxes were modeled by kinetic equations with saturation and inhibition effects from external medium components. Importantly, one set of kinetic parameters was estimated using experimental data of the multiple metabolic states. A good fit between the model and the data was obtained for the majority of the metabolites and the experimentally observed flux variations. We find that the poly-pathway modeling approach is promising for the simulation of multiple metabolic states.']\n",

In recent years, several bench, pilot and commercial scale membrane distillation systems with production capacities ranging from 20 L/d to 50 m(3)/d were developed and tested. In this work, a single cassette air-gap membrane distillation (AGMD) module was characterized to identify the effect of process parameters on distillate flux and thermal efficiency. Favorable conditions to obtain distillate flow rate of 1.5-3 kg/h were determined on a bench scale experimental setup. Factorial design of experiments was conducted and response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to develop an empirical regression model relating operating parameters with AGMD system performance indicators. Operating parameters including hot feed inlet temperature (T-Hin), cold feed inlet temperature (T-Cin), feed flow rate (V-f) and feed conductivity (C-f) were considered. Distillate flux (J(d)) and specific performance ratio (SPR) were selected as the performance indicators for the modeling. The developed regression model using RSM was tested by analysis of variance. Regression analysis showed agreement with the experimental data fitted with second-order polynomial model having determination coefficient (R-2) values of 0.996 and 0.941 for J(d) and SPR, respectively. Numerical optimization has been carried out to identify optimal set of operating conditions for achieving desired operation.

Interestingly, the staphylococcal output repertoire and the binders from the phage display selection contained two slightly different sets of clones, containing both unique as well as several similar variants. All of the Nanobodies from the staphylococcal selection were also shown to enhance the fluorescence of GFP upon binding, potentially due to the fluorescence-based sorting principle.

The aim of this study was to engineer and investigate an expression vector system with dual functionalities: i) recombinant display of Affibody libraries on Escherichia coli for directed evolution and ii) small scale secreted production of candidate affinity proteins, allowing initial downstream characterizations prior to subcloning. Autotransporters form a class of surface proteins in Gram-negative bacteria that have potential for efficient translocation and tethering of recombinant passenger proteins to the outer membrane. We engineered a bacterial display vector based on the E. coli AIDA-I autotransporter for anchoring to the bacterial surface. Potential advantages of employing autotransporters combined with E. coli as host include: high surface expression level, high transformation frequency, alternative promoter systems available, efficient translocation to the outer membrane and tolerance for large multi-domain passenger proteins. Results: The new vector was designed to comprise an expression cassette encoding for an Affibody molecule, three albumin binding domains for monitoring of surface expression levels, an Outer membrane Protease T (OmpT) recognition site for potential protease-mediated secretion of displayed affinity proteins and a histidine-tag for purification. A panel of vectors with different promoters were generated and evaluated, and suitable cultivation conditions were investigated. The results demonstrated a high surface expression level of the different evaluated Affibody molecules, high correlation between target binding and surface expression level, high signal-to-background ratio, efficient secretion and purification of binders in OmpT-positive hosts as well as tight regulation of surface expression for the titratable promoters. Importantly, a mock selection using FACS from a 1: 100,000 background yielded around 20,000-fold enrichment in a single round and high viability of the isolated bacteria after sorting. Conclusions: The new expression vectors are promising for combinatorial engineering of Affibody molecules and the strategy for small-scale production of soluble recombinant proteins has the potential to increase throughput of the entire discovery process.']\n",

      "[\"Aggregation of misfolded peptides and proteins is a key event in several neurodegenerative diseases. Suggested treatments of such disorders aim to inhibit the initial aggregation process. Here, we have developed an intracellular, function-based screening method, intended for isolation of aggregation-inhibitors from combinatorial protein libraries by flow-cytometric cell sorting. The method is based on fusion of aggregation-prone peptides to a fluorescent protein, functioning as a solubility reporter. Co-expression of a protein-based aggregation-inhibitor should prevent aggregation and thus increase the whole-cell fluorescence. We evaluated the method using the aggregation-prone Alzheimer's-related amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) peptide in fusion to green-fluorescent protein (GFP), and an AÎ² aggregation-inhibiting Affibody molecule. To adapt the method for library applications, the inhibitor was linked to an mCherry reporter for normalization of protein expression levels. We found that aggregation propensity correlates with fluorescence intensity, as co-expression of the Affibody-inhibitor increased the whole-cell fluorescence relative to a non-inhibitor. Employing improved cultivation parameters, we furthermore demonstrated efficient rescue from aggregation of an Î±-synuclein-derived protein using a different type of aggregation-inhibitor. Importantly, we also showed that the AÎ² aggregation-inhibiting Affibody molecule could be isolated from a 1:10,000 background of non-inhibitors, with around 3,500-fold enrichment, in one cycle of fluorescence-based cell sorting.

      "['Proteases are involved in fundamental biological processes and are important tools in both biotechnological and biomedical research. An important property of proteases is to discriminate among potential substrates. Here, a new method for substrate profiling of proteases is presented. The substrates are displayed between two anti-idiotypic affinity domains on the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus carnosus. The first domain functions as a reporter tag and has affinity for a labeled reporter protein, whereas the second domain blocks the reporter tag from interacting with the reporter protein. Site-specific proteolysis of the substrate results in release of the blocking domain, enabling the reporter tag to bind the labeled reporter protein. Proteolysis is therefore reflected in reporter binding, which is quantified by flow cytometry. First, the method with tobacco etch virus protease (TEVp) is evaluated and then the substrate preference of matrix metalloprotease-1 (MMP-1) is determined using two libraries of around three million substrates each. Identified substrate peptides contained the previously reported motif (PXXXHy) and on-cell determination of apparent kcat/KM revealed that the enriched substrate peptides are hydrolyzed six to eight-fold more efficiently than a previously reported substrate peptide. The method thus works as intended and the authors believe it has potential as an efficient tool for substrate profiling.']\n",

We demonstrate that this effect should take place in s + is superconductors, which are widely discussed in connection with iron-based materials (although the mechanism is much more general). In these systems a vortex excitation can create a \"bubble\" of fluctuating Z(2) order parameter. The thermal excitation of vortices then leads to the breakdown of Z(2) time-reversal symmetry when the temperature is increased.']\n",

First, assuming that full channel state information (CSI) of the two hop channels is available, a suboptimal dual hop joint precoding scheme, i.e., precoding at both the base station and relay station, is investigated. Based on its structure, a scheme of limited feedback joint precoding using joint codebooks is then proposed, which uses a distributed codeword selection to concurrently choose two joint precoders such that the feedback delay is considerably decreased. Finally, the joint codebook design for the limited feedback joint precoding system is analyzed, and results reveal that independent codebook designs at the base station and relay station using the conventional Grassmannian subspace packing method is able to guarantee that the overall performance of the dual hop joint precoding scheme improves with the size of each of the two codebooks. Simulation results show that the proposed dual hop joint precoding system using distributed codeword selection scheme exhibits a rate or BER performance close to the one using the optimal centralized codeword selection scheme, while having lower computational complexity and shorter feedback delay.']\n",

In a system with limited channel state information at each source and relay node, an optimum distributed power allocation strategy is proposed to minimize the total transmit power, providing a target signal-to-noise ratio at each destination with a target outage probability. Moreover, combined with opportunistic relaying and network coding, a distributed decision mechanism is proposed for the relay node to decide whether to help the transmission or not. In this proposal, each source works out the transmit power and the decision threshold then broadcasts them. The selected relay compares the decision threshold with the channel gain of its weaker relay-to-destination link, then determines whether to forward the networkcoded data or not. Simulation results show the advantage of this strategy in terms of energy efficiency for a two-hop two-way communication scenario. The proposed strategy is very flexible as it can trade outage to power consumption and vice versa.']\n",

For this problem, the existing precoder designs often assume a sum power constraint (SPC) and rely on the singular value decomposition (SVD).

Then, we propose an efficient numerical algorithm to find the optimal precoders subject to per-antenna power constraints (PAPCs). To this end, the precoder design for PAPCs is formulated as an optimization problem with a rank constraint on the covariance matrices. A well-known approach to solve this problem is to relax the rank constraints and solve the relaxed problem. Interestingly, for SZF-DPC, we are able to prove that the rank relaxation is tight. Consequently, the optimal precoder design for PAPCs is computed by solving the relaxed problem, for which we propose a customized interior-point method that exhibits a superlinear convergence rate. Two suboptimal precoder designs are also presented and compared to the optimal ones. We also show that the proposed numerical method is applicable for finding the optimal precoders for block diagonalization scheme.']\n",

      "[\"We consider the uplink of a cellular massive multiple-input multiple-output network. Acquiring channel state information at the base stations (BSs) requires uplink pilot signaling. Since the number of orthogonal pilot sequences is limited by the channel coherence, pilot reuse across cells is necessary to achieve high spectral efficiency. However, finding efficient pilot reuse patterns is non-trivial, especially in practical asymmetric BS deployments. We approach this problem using the coalitional game theory. Each BS has a few unique pilots and can form coalitions with other BSs to gain access to more pilots. The BSs in a coalition, thus, benefit from serving more users in their cells at the expense of higher pilot contamination and interference. Given that a cell's average spectral efficiency depends on the overall pilot reuse pattern, the suitable coalitional game model is in the partition form. We develop a low-complexity distributed coalition formation based on individual stability. By incorporating a BS intercommunication budget constraint, we are able to control the overhead in message exchange between the BSs and ensure the algorithm's convergence to a solution of the game called individually stable coalition structure. Simulation results reveal fast algorithmic convergence and substantial performance gains over the baseline schemes with no pilot reuse, full pilot reuse, or random pilot reuse pattern.\"]\n",

Conclusion: Neonatal respiratory distress is associated with changes in beta-ENaC and AQP5 expression. The lower beta-ENaC expression may be one of the factors that predispose to the development of RDS.

The involved limb is usually smaller and shorter, although it is not clear whether the difference in muscle volume has an impact on walking capacity. Questions/purposes: We determined the volume of muscles important for propulsion and related that volume to concentric muscle work during walking on the hemiplegic and noninvolved sides in patients with cerebral palsy. Patients and Methods: We studied 46 patients (mean age, 17.6 years; range, 13-24 years) with spastic hemiplegic cerebral palsy. We assessed muscle volume using MRI and concentric muscle work in the sagittal plane from the hip, knee, and ankle using three-dimensional gait analysis. Patients were classified by Winters' criteria to assess the involvement of cerebral palsy and movement pattern during walking. Results: On the hemiplegic side, muscles were smaller, except for the gracilis muscle, and concentric muscle work from the ankle plantar flexors, knee extensors, and hip flexors and extensors was lower compared to the noninvolved side. Hip extensor work was higher on the hemiplegic and the noninvolved sides compared to a control group of 14 subjects without cerebral palsy. Hemiplegic to noninvolved volume ratios correlated with work ratios (r = 0.40-0.66). The Winters classification and previous calf muscle surgery predicted work ratios. Conclusions: Our observations of smaller muscles on the hemiplegic side and changes in muscle work on both sides can help us distinguish between primary deviations that may potentially be treatable and compensatory mechanisms that should not be treated.\"]\n",

Chemical agonists and antagonists of platelets activation, aggregation, and adhesion and the proteins involved in the coagulation cascade (CC) may play an important role in ILT development. Starting from this assumption, the evolution of chemical species involved in the CC, their relation to coherent vortical structures (VSs) and their possible effect on ILT evolution have been studied. To this end a fluid-chemical model that simulates the CC through a series of convection-diffusion-reaction (CDR) equations has been developed. The model involves plasma-phase and surface-bound enzymes and zymogens, and includes both plasma-phase and membrane-phase reactions. Blood is modeled as a non-Newtonian incompressible fluid. VSs convect thrombin in the domain and lead to the high concentration observed in the distal portion of the AAA. This finding is in line with the clinical observations showing that the thickest ILT is usually seen in the distal AAA region. The proposed model, due to its ability to couple the fluid and chemical domains, provides an integrated mechanochemical picture that potentially could help unveil mechanisms of ILT formation and development.']\n",

Twenty-four-hour Holter-electrocardiogram monitoring was performed at an average age of 9 y. Heart rate variability results were analyzed using frequency and time domain methods. RESULTS: All frequency components and both time domain parameters tested were significantly lower in the preterm and SGA children compared with controls. The low frequency/high frequency ratio was not significantly different between children born with LBW and controls. CONCLUSION: The autonomic control appears to be affected in children born with LBW despite gestational age at birth. Decreased total power, as an estimation of the ANS's global activity, rather than the balance between parasympathetic and sympathetic modulation might be an early marker of cardiovascular disease later on in life for LBW born children.\"]\n",

A kinetic analysis reveals that hydrogen bond stabilization of the transition state and substrate binding are key components of the catalytic process. In the case of substrate binding, which has the greater potential for optimization, both binding strength and positioning of the substrates are important for catalytic efficiency. The binding strength is determined by hydrophobic interactions and can be tuned by careful selection of solvent and substrates. The MD simulations show that substrate positioning is sensitive to cavity shape and size, and can be controlled by a few rational mutations. The well-documented S105A mutation is essential to enable sufficient space in the vicinity of the oxyanion hole.

The room temperature coercive field (He) of the CoFe2O4/CTAB nanocomposite was found to be 1045 Oe which is close to the previously reported room temperature values for bulk CoFe2O4. The H-c, was observed to decrease almost linearly with the square root of the temperature (root T) according to Kneller's law. From the linear fit of H-c versus root T, the zero-temperature coercivity (H-c0) and superparamagnetic blocking temperature (T-B) of the CoFe2O4/CTAB nanocomposite were found to be similar to 9.1 kOe and similar to 425 K, respectively. The remanence magnetization (M-r), the reduced remanent magnetization (M-r/M-s), and the effective magnetic anisotropy (K-eff) decrease with increasing temperature. The M-r/M-s value of 0.6 at 10 K higher than the theoretical value of 0.5 for non-interacting single domain particles with the easy axis randomly oriented suggests the CoFe2O4/CTAB nanocomposite to have cubic magnetocrystalline anisotropy according to the Stoner Wohlfarth model.\"]\n",

LignoBoost lignin was (i) suspended in acid water with xylan added and (ii) dissolved together with xylan and then re-precipitated. The resulting lignin-xylan mixtures were more difficult to filter than the original LignoBoost lignin, although the formed filter cake was also found more porous in the case of re-precipitated solids. Furthermore, the pressure dependency of the filtration properties was shown to increase after the addition of xylan. One possible explanation based on the findings presented in this paper is that xylan is sorbed at the surface of the lignin agglomerates: it increases the contact area between solid and liquid, thus making the particle structure more porous. The influence of ionic strength was also investigated through the addition of sodium sulphate: it was found that increasing the ionic strength of the slurries made the solids easier to separate, possibly due to a decrease in electrostatic repulsive interactions between the solids and the formation of a denser solid structure.']\n",

Fast acidification led to a more heterogeneous formation of particles, having a broader particle size distribution, compared to slow acidification. Chemical analysis of different layers of the filter cakes formed revealed that xylan was distributed evenly on the solid lignin, reinforcing the hypothesis that xylan is sorbed onto the lignin agglomerates when precipitated together with lignin. Furthermore, the resulting lignin-xylan mixtures were found to be more difficult to filter in the case of a higher final pH of the slurry (pH 4), close to the pKa values of the carboxylic acid groups of xylan, compared to lower pH values (pH 1-3). This is likely the result of an increase in electrostatic repulsive interactions between the particles/agglomerates at higher pH: a locally more porous solid structure is formed, leading to a larger solid/liquid surface area during filtration.']\n",

With position tolerances in the sub-mu m range over square meter sized masks, the metrology challenges are indeed demanding. Most systems used for this type of measurement rely on a microscope camera imaging system, provided with a charge coupled device, a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor sensor or a time delay and integration sensor to transform the optical image to a digital gray-level image. From this image, processing algorithms are used to extract information such as location of edges. The drawback of this technique is the vast amount of data captured but never used. This paper presents a new approach for ultra-high-precision lateral measurement at nm-levels of chrome/glass patterns separated by centimeters, so called registration marks, on masks used for the LCD manufacturing. Registration specifications demand a positioning accuracy &lt;200 nm and critical dimensions, i.e. chrome line widths, which need to be accurate in the 80 nm range. This accuracy has to be achieved on glass masks of 2.4 x 1.6 m(2) size. Our new measurement method is based on nm-precise lateral scanning of a focused laser beam combined with statistical random phase sampling of the reflected signal. The precise scanning is based on an extremely accurate time measuring device controlling an acousto optic deflector crystal.

A mechanism is suggested for the heterogeneous polymerization of styrene mediated by iron (II)-chloride in p-xylene at 50 °C. Varying the mediator amount more than 10-fold revealed that the rate limiting step at low mediator amounts was the adsorption of the initiator or dormant polymer to the mediator surface, whereas at higher mediator amounts, the rate limiting step was instead the activation step in the ATRP equilibrium.

Here we postulate a novel magneto-optical phenomenon that originates solely from suitably designed nanostructured metal-dielectric material, the so-called magneto-plasmonic crystal. In this material, an incident light excites coupled plasmonic oscillations and a waveguide mode. An in-plane magnetic field allows excitation of an orthogonally polarized waveguide mode that modifies optical spectrum of the magneto-plasmonic crystal and increases its transparency. The experimentally achieved light intensity modulation reaches 24%. As the effect can potentially exceed 100%, it may have great importance for applied nanophotonics.

Direct numerical simulations of exothermic reacting turbulent wall-jets are performed and compared to the isothermal reacting case. An evaluation of the heat-release effects on the structure of turbulence is given by examining the mixture fraction surface characteristics, diagnosing vortices and exploring the dissipation rate of the fuel and passive scalar concentrations, and moreover by illustration of probability density functions of reacting species and scatter plots of the local temperature against the mixture fraction. Primarily, heat release effects delay the transition, enlarge the fluctuation intensities of density and pressure and also enhance the fluctuation level of the species concentrations. However, it has a damping effect on all velocity fluctuation intensities and the Reynolds shear stress. A key result is that the fine-scale structures of turbulence are damped, the surface wrinkling is diminished and the vortices become larger due to heat-release effects. Taking into account the varying density by using semi-local scaling improves the collapse of the turbulence statistics in the inner region, but does not eliminate heat release induced differences in the outer region. Examining the two-dimensional premultiplied spanwise spectra of the streamwise velocity fluctuations indicates a shifting in the positions of the outer peaks, associated with large energetic structures, toward the inner region.']\n",

The toxicity of each antimetabolite was predicted by assessing the in silico functionality of 83 healthy cell type-specific GEMs, which were also reconstructed with the tINIT algorithm. We predicted 101 antimetabolites that could be effective in preventing tumor growth in all HCC patients, and 46 antimetabolites which were specific to individual patients. Twenty-two of the 101 predicted antimetabolites have already been used in different cancer treatment strategies, while the remaining antimetabolites represent new potential drugs.

Alloy and reference particles exposed in vitro in synthetic biological fluids relevant for these main exposure routes have been investigated in a large research effort combining bioaccessibility; chemical speciation; and material, surface, and particle characteristics. In this paper, data for the dermal exposure route, including skin and eye contact, will be presented and discussed.

Measured released amounts of Fe, Cr, and Ni are presented in terms of average Fe and Cr release rates and amounts released per amount of particles loaded. The results are discussed in relation to bulk and surface composition of the particles. Additional information, essential to assess the bioavailability of Cr released, was generated by determining its chemical speciation and by providing information on its complexation and oxidation states in both media investigated. The effect of differences in experimental temperature, 30 °C and 37 °C, on the extent of metal release in artificial sweat is demonstrated. Iron was the preferentially released element in all test media and for all time periods and ironcontaining particles investigated. The extent of metal release was highly pH dependent and was also dependent on the medium composition.

This process involves detailed assessment of potential hazards for various toxicity endpoints induced by the use of chemicals with a minimum use of animal testing. Such an assessment requires thorough understanding of relevant exposure scenarios including material characteristics and intrinsic properties and how, for instance, physical and chemical properties change from the manufacturing phase, throughout use, to final disposal. Temporary or permanent adverse health effects induced by particles depend either on their shape or physical characteristics, and/or on chemical interactions with the particle surface upon human exposure. Potential adverse effects caused by the exposure of metal particles through the gastrointestinal system, the pulmonary system, or the skin, and their subsequent potential for particle dissolution and metal release in contact with biological media, show significant gaps of knowledge. In vitro bioaccessibility testing at conditions of relevance for different exposure scenarios, combined with the generation of a detailed understanding of intrinsic material properties and surface characteristics, are in this context a useful approach to address aspects of relevance for accurate risk and hazard assessment of chemicals, including metals and alloys and to avoid the use of in vivo testing. Alloys are essential engineering materials in all kinds of applications in society, but their potential adverse effects on human health and the environment are very seldom assessed. Alloys are treated in REACH as mixtures of their constituent elements, an approach highly inappropriate because intrinsic properties of alloys generally are totally different compared with their pure metal components. A large research effort was therefore conducted to generate quantitative bioaccessibility data for particles of ferro-chromium alloys compared with particles of the pure metals and stainless steel exposed at in vitro conditions in synthetic biological media of relevance for particle inhalation and ingestion. All results are presented combining bioaccessibility data with aspects of particle characteristics, surface composition, and barrier properties of surface oxides. Iron and chromium were the main elements released from ferro-chromium alloys upon exposure in synthetic biological media. Both elements revealed time-dependent release processes. One week exposures resulted in very small released particle fractions being less than 0.3% of the particle mass at acidic conditions and less than 0.001% in near pH-neutral media.

This was done by assessing the extent and speciation of released metals in synthetic biological medium and by analyzing particle reactivity and toxicity towards cultured human lung cells (A549).</p><p>Results</p><p>The amount of released metals normalized to the particle surface area increased with decreasing particle size for all alloy particles, whereas the opposite situation was valid for particles of the pure metals. These effects were evident in artificial lysosomal fluid (ALF) of pH 4.5 containing complexing agents, but not in neutral or weakly alkaline biological media. Chromium, iron and nickel were released to very low extent from all alloy particles, and from particles of Cr due to the presence of a Cr(III)-rich protective surface oxide. Released elements were neither proportional to the bulk nor to the surface composition after the investigated 168 hours of exposure. Due to a surface oxide with less protective properties, significantly more iron was released from pure iron particles compared with the alloys. Cr was predominantly released as Cr(III) from all particles investigated and was strongly complexed by organic species of ALF. Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>particles showed hemolytic activity, but none of the alloy particles did. Fine-sized particles of stainless steel caused however DNA damage, measured with the comet assay after 4 h exposure. None of the particles revealed any significant cytotoxicity in terms of cell death after 24 h exposure.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>It is evident that particle and alloy characteristics such as particle size and surface composition are important aspects to consider when assessing particle toxicity and metal release from alloy particles compared to pure metal particles. Generated results clearly elucidate that neither the low released concentrations of metals primarily as a result of protective and poorly soluble surface oxides, nor non-bioavailable chromium complexes, nor the particles themselves of occupational relevance induced significant acute toxic response, with exception of DNA damage from stainless steel.']\n",

The aim of this study is to compare the release of alloy constituents from stainless steel powders of different grades (focus on AISI 316L) and production routes into synthetic body fluids with the release of the same metals from massive sheet in relation to material and surface characteristics. The comparison is justified by the fact that the difference between massive surfaces and powders from a metal release/dissolution and surface perspective is not clearly elucidated within current legislations. Powders and abraded and aged (24 h) massive sheets were exposed to synthetic solutions of relevance for biological settings and human exposure routes, for periods up to one week.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, microscopy, light scattering, and nitrogen absorption were employed for the particle and surface oxide characterization. Atomic absorption spectroscopy was used to quantify released amounts of metals in solution. Cytotoxicity (Alamar blue assay) and DNA damage (comet assay) of the Inconel powder were assessed following exposure of the human lung cell line A549, as well as its ability to generate reactive oxygen species (DCFH-DA assay). Despite its high nickel content, the Inconel alloy powder did not release any significant amounts of metals and did not induce any toxic response. It is concluded, that this is related to the high surface passivity of the Inconel powder governed by its chromium-rich surface oxide.

      "[\"In this work the transmit covariance matrix optimization problem for the discrete memoryless MIMO Gaussian bidirectional broadcast channel is studied. A half-duplex relay node establishes bidirectional communication between two nodes using a decode-and-forward protocol. In the initial multiple access phase both nodes transmit their messages to the relay node. In the succeeding phase the relay broadcasts an optimal re-encoded message so that both nodes can decode the other's message using their own message as side information. The capacity region of the bidirectional broadcast channel is completely characterized by a weighted rate sum maximization problem, which can be solved by a simple iterative fixed point algorithm. If an efficient transmit covariance matrix is invariant with respect to the joint subspace spanned by the channels, then different combinations of the part transmitted on the orthogonal subspaces result in equivalent transmit strategies with different ranks. A closed-form procedure to obtain the optimal transmit covariance is derived for the case where the rank of the channels is equal to the number of antennas at the relay node and a full-rank transmission is optimal. It shows the complicated structure of the optimal eigenspace, which depends on the weights and the mean transmit power constraint. For parallel channels the optimal solution is completely characterized and discussed, which also solves the optimal power allocation problem for a single-antenna OFDM system.\"]\n",

Interestingly, the antibacterial efficacy of this system was greater than that of the previous PVAm/PAA/PVAm system.

Adsorbed amounts of bacteria on either aggregate or flat regions were quantified by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). More adsorbed bacteria were clearly seen on aggregates than on the flat regions at the surfaces. Degrees of bacteria deformation and cell damage were also seen under SEM.

Fresh powder samples of the catalyst were characterized by XRD, N(2)-BET, H(2) chemisorption, H(2)-TPR and XPS analyses. The activity results showed that high fuel conversions and hydrogen production could be achieved with 3 wt% Rh for all fuels. Furthermore, the highest formation of CO and C(2)H(4) was found in the product gas stream from the low-sulfur diesel. In addition, partial oxidation and steam reforming reactions were identified by closely studying the distribution of the analyzed product gas composition and the temperature measurements. The characterization results showed the presence of finely dispersed Rh particles in the support. Furthermore, bulk and surface rhodium oxides were detected, which have been suggested to be one of the major active phases for ATR of diesel. Bulk and surface cerium oxides (CeO(2)) and surface La in the dispersed phase were also found to be present in the catalyst composition. These promoters are believed to improve the catalyst activity and durability.']\n",

      "['The objective of this paper is to study and clarify the role of selected supports (both reducible and non-reducible) on the activity, selectivity and stability of RhPt-based catalyst for diesel reforming. Autothermal reforming (AIR) of low-sulfur diesel (S similar to 6 ppm, C/H similar to 6.43 (w/w)), H(2)O/C similar to 2.5, O(2)/C similar to 0.49, was tested at bench scale to detect differences in activity for catalysts consisting of 1 wt% Rh and 1 wt% Pt supported on alumina, ceria-zirconia (17.5 wt% ceria), silica and titania. Promoters in the form of MgO. Y(2)O(3), La(2)O(3), CeO(2) and ZrO(2), ranging from 4 wt% to 10 wt%, were also added onto the supports to detect differences in catalyst activity in terms of diesel conversion, CO(2) selectivity, and hydrogen and ethylene production. All metals were added sequentially onto the support by the incipient wetness technique and washcoated on 400 cpsi cordierite monolithic carriers with dimensions d = 17.8 mm, l=30.5 mm.</p><p>The product gas analysis, using FTIR and NDIR, showed that RhPt/CeO(2)-ZrO(2) was found to be most active for AIR of diesel since a fuel conversion close to 98% was obtained. Furthermore, the catalyst activity of the unpromoted samples, in terms of diesel conversion, increased in the following order: RhPt/SiO(2) &lt; RhPt/TiO(2) &lt; RhPt/Al(2)O(3) &lt; RhPt/CeO(2)-ZrO(2). The addition of promoters was found to be insignificant as well as having a negative impact on the catalyst performance in most cases, except for the alumina-promoted sample. The addition of 10 wt% La(2)O(3) on RhPt/Al(2)O(3) was found to enhance diesel conversion, hydrogen productivity as well as lower the ethylene concentration from 3700 ppm to less than half that value. The latter observation was confirmed by O(2)-TPO analysis of aged powder samples where lower loads of coke were present than on the La-promoted sample.</p><p>The morphology, surface and bulk properties of RhPt/CeO(2)-ZrO(2) were closely examined in order to provide a possible correlation between the activity and characterization results. N(2)-BET analysis showed that the surface area of RhPt/CeO(2)-ZrO(2) was 64 m(2)/g, while the silica samples exhibited the highest area, similar to 137-185 m(2)/g. Hence, the difference in the surface areas was not enough to explain the trends observed in the activity measurements. XRD analysis of RhPt/CeO(2)-ZrO(2) showed crystalline phases characteristic of zirconia, most likely tetragonal. Also, the diffractogram did not reveal any Rh or Pt peaks indicating that the noble metal particles are highly dispersed on the support. In contrast, peaks ascribed to metallic Pt (similar to 30-46 nm) were clearly visible on the XRD patterns taken from all the other supported samples. H(2)-TPR analysis of RhPt/CeO(2)-ZrO(2) showed reduction peaks ascribed to Rh(i)O(x) species as well as a minor hydrogen spillover effect on the support to be present at T=120 degrees C and 450 degrees C, respectively. Also, the hydrogen consumption of the Rh(i)O(x) species was the highest compared to the other supported RhPt samples. TEM analysis performed on fresh RhPt/CeO(2)-ZrO(2) showed that the Rh(i)O(x) and Pt particles were highly dispersed on the support, both with particle sizes in the vicinity of similar to 5-15 nm. Rh species was found on ceria and zirconia, while Pt was present mainly on the ceria layer possibly in the form of Pt-O-Ce bonds. H(2)-chemisorption analysis measured at T similar to 40 degrees C shows similar Rh dispersion results.</p><p>To summarize, the higher activity results of RhPt/CeO(2)-ZrO(2) for AIR of diesel, compared to other supported catalysts, may be ascribed to the higher reducibility of Rh(i)O(x) species as well as the superior Rh and Pt dispersion. Also, the support contribution, in particular ceria, is believed to promote water gas-shift activities as well as reduce coke deposits on the catalyst surface.']\n",

At the exit of a straight pipe nozzle of radius r(0), the jet is ideally expanded, and has a Mach number of 1.5 and a Reynolds number of 6 x 10(4). Four distances between the nozzle exit and the flat plate, equal to 6r(0), 8r(0), 10r(0) and 12r(0), have been considered. In this way, the variations of the convection velocity of the shear-layer turbulent structures according to the nozzle-to-plate distance are shown. In the spectra obtained inside and outside of the flow near the nozzle, several tones emerge at Strouhal numbers in agreement with measurements in the literature. At these frequencies, by applying Fourier decomposition to the pressure fields, hydrodynamic-acoustic standing waves containing a whole number of cells between the nozzle and the plate and axisymmetric or helical jet oscillations are found. The tone frequencies and the mode numbers inferred from the standing-wave patterns are in line with the classical feedback-loop model, in which the loop is closed by acoustic waves outside the jet. The axisymmetric or helical nature of the jet oscillations at the tone frequencies is also consistent with a wave analysis using a jet vortex-sheet model, providing the allowable frequency ranges for the upstream-propagating acoustic wave modes of the jet. In particular, the tones are located on the part of the dispersion relations of the modes where these waves have phase and group velocities close to the ambient speed of sound. Based on the observation of the pressure fields and on frequency-wavenumber spectra on the jet axis and in the shear layers, such waves are identified inside the present jets, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, for a supersonic jet flow. This study thus suggests that the feedback loop in ideally expanded impinging jets is completed by these waves.']\n",

Four jets are underexpanded and four jets are ideally expanded, which allowed examination of the influence of the presence of shock-cell structures. The underexpanded jets are characterized by a fully expanded Mach number of 1.56 and an exit Mach number of 1. The ideally expanded jets have a Mach number of 1.5. The Reynolds number of the eight jets is equal to 6x104. The jets impinge normally on a flat plate located from 4.16r0 to 12r0 downstream of the nozzle and generate acoustic tones due to an aeroacoustic feedback mechanism. In this paper, the near pressure and density fields of the jets are characterized using Fourier transform on the nozzle exit plane, the plate, and an azimuthal plane. First, mean and rms radial velocities of the wall jets are examined. The impact of the shock-cell structure on the wall jet is discussed. The pressure spectra on the plate are then shown as a function of the radial coordinate. The tone frequencies are all visible where the jet shear layers impinge the plate, but only some of them emerge in the wall jet created after the impact. For the ideally expanded jets, the temporal organization of the wall jet along the frequencies of the feedback mechanism decreases with the nozzle-to-plate distance, but for the nonideally expanded jets, this organization is linked to the oscillation of the Mach disk located just upstream of the plate. Consecutively, the amplitude and the phase fields at the tone frequencies are represented on the three planes mentioned earlier. Similar spatial organizations of the turbulent structures are found in the jet shear layers and in the wall jets. Thus, axisymmetric and helical arrangements of the structures in the jet shear layers lead to concentric and spiral distributions of the structures on the plate, respectively. In particular, for one of the underexpanded jets, a spiral shape and concentric rings, associated with two tone frequencies generated simultaneously, are observed on the flat plate in the pressure and density phase fields. Finally, the convection velocity of the turbulent structures at the tone frequencies in the wall jets are evaluated based on phase fields, and the mean convection velocity is computed using cross correlations of radial velocity. The results are in good agreement with those from a recent experimental study of ideally expanded impinging jets.']\n",

The main aim of the present study is to elucidate the influence of the non-equilibrium microstructure obtained by SLM on corrosion susceptibility and extent of metal release (measure of biocompatibility). Methods. A multi-analytical approach has been employed by combining microscopic and bulk compositional tools with electrochemical techniques and chemical analyses of metals in biologically relevant fluids for three differently SLM fabricated CoCrMo alloys and one cast CoCrMo alloy used for comparison. Results. Rapid cooling and strong temperature gradients during laser melting resulted in the formation of a fine cellular structure with cell boundaries enriched in Mo (Co depleted), and suppression of carbide precipitation and formation of a martensitic epsilon (hcp) phase at the surface. These features were shown to decrease the corrosion and metal release susceptibility of the SLM alloys compared with the cast alloy. Unique textures formed in the pattern of the melting pools of the three different laser melted CoCrMo alloys predominantly explain observed small, though significant, differences. The susceptibility for corrosion and metal release increased with an increased number (area) of laser melt pool boundaries. Significance. This study shows that integrative and interdisciplinary studies of microstructural characteristics, corrosion, and metal release are essential to assess and consider during the design and fabrication of CoCrMo dental components of optimal biocompatibility. The reason is that the extent of metal release from CoCrMo is dependent on fabrication procedures.']\n",

One of the main distresses that M-E design methods attempt to control is permanent deformation (rutting). The objective of this paper is to evaluate three M-E permanent deformation models for unbound granular materials, one from the US M-E pavement design guide and two other relatively new models. Two series of heavy vehicle simulator (HVS) tests with three different types of base material were used for this purpose. The permanent deformation, wheel loading, pavement temperature, and other material properties were continuously controlled during the HVS tests. Asphalt concrete layers were considered as linear elastic where stress-dependent behaviour of unbound materials was considered when computing responses for the M-E permanent deformation models with a nonlinear elastic response model. Traffic wandering was also accounted for in modelling the traffic by assuming it was normally distributed and a time-hardening approach was applied to add together the permanent deformation contributions from different stress levels. The measured and predicted permanent deformations are in general in good agreement with only small discrepancies between the models. Model parameters were also estimated for three different types of material.']\n",

A finite element method is relied upon in order to establish the response function for a linear viscoelastic pavement structure with dynamic effects taken into account. In order to characterise the dynamic loads induced on the pavement by moving traffic, a quarter car model combined with measured road profiles is used. Once both the traffic loads and pavement response functions are known, the stresses and strains induced in the pavement can be obtained in the frequency-wavenumber domain through the convolution procedure. The computational procedure developed is applied in the present study to evaluate the effect of the pavement surface roughness on the pavement structure response to truck traffic loading. Stress field parameters governing fracture initiation in asphalt layers are reported for two measured road roughness profiles. It is shown that the dynamic effects at vehicle-road interaction may have a profound influence on the stresses induced in flexible pavements; therefore, these effects need to be taken into account for the accurate estimation of the road resistance to cracking.']\n",

A predictive function for surface deterioration, based on average gradient of yearly measurements of the road surface profile in Swedish road network, is proposed. In order to characterise the dynamic loads induced on the pavement by moving traffic a quarter car model is used. Afterwards a non-stationary stochastic approach is used to obtain the yearly response of the pavement to moving loads. The solution is in frequency-wavenumber domain and is given for a non-stationary random case as the pavement surface deteriorates in pavement service life influencing thus the magnitude of the dynamic loads induced by the vehicles.

To solve this problem, in this study, the polypropylene membrane fiber was modified by depositing a rough layer on the surface to improve its hydrophobicity. Weighing the coating homogeneity, hydrophobicity and modification process efficiency, the mixture of cyclohexanone and MEK system was considered as the best non-solvent. The contact angle increased dramatically from 122 to 158 by the modification, thereby obtaining superhydrophobic membrane surface. The membrane-absorbent interaction results demonstrated that the modification treatment effectively enhanced the stability and maintained the superhydrophobicity of fibers contacting with the absorbent. In addition, continuous CO(2) absorption experiments for up to 20 days were carried out in untreated and modified polypropylene hollow fiber membrane contactors, using 1 mol L(-1) MEA solution as the absorbent. The long-term system operation results indicated that, even though additional mass transfer resistance was introduced by the surface coating, the modified polypropylene hollow fiber membrane contactor was still technically feasible for CO(2) capture from the power stations.']\n",

The experimental results indicated that the membrane contactor could eliminate these two sour gases simultaneously and effectively. Absorption of SO2 and CO2 was enhanced by the increase in liquid flow rate and decrease in gas flow rate. It was observed that a small amount of SO2 in the flue gas had a slight influence on the absorption of CO2. In addition, the membrane contactor was operated continuously for two weeks to evaluate its duration performance. The results showed that the CO2 mass transfer rate was decreased significantly with the operating time due to partial wetting of membrane pores.

In this study, with a polypropylene (PP) hollow fiber membrane contactor as absorber and a packed column as stripper, the influence of SO2 on the CO2 capture from coal-fired power plant flue gas was investigated in an absorption-desorption experimental set-up using aqueous monoethanolamine (MEA) as the absorbent. The experimental results showed that the MEA loss per ton captured CO2 increased with the addition of SO2, resulting in sharp decreases in CO2 removal efficiency and mass transfer rate of CO2 after initial several days of operation. This tendency is mainly attributed to the promotional effect of SO2 on the degradation of MEA by the formation of sulfate. Thus, it is necessary to regenerate MEA using a reclaimer in this case. The respective SO2 concentrations at the outlets of absorber and stripper remained constant values of 24 and 120ppb throughout the operation although the CO2 removal efficiency decreased dramatically with time. This co-capture of CO2 and SO2 could play an important role in further desulfuration, thus alleviating the burden of desulfuration to some extent and benefiting the subsequent CO2 purification and storage. More progresses are greatly needed in high-efficiency and stable absorbents, high-efficiency reclaimer, and methods to reduce MEA loss by evaporation.']\n",

These mechanisms help ensure the reliable operation of the electricity system by compensating for fluctuations in supply or demand. However, a focus on short-term balancing is sometimes neglected when assessing future capacity expansions with long-term energy system models. Developing heuristics that can simulate short-term system issues is one way of augmenting the functionality of such models. To this end, we present an extended functionality to the Open Source Energy Modelling System (OSeMOSYS), which captures the impacts of short-term variability of supply and demand on system adequacy and security. Specifically, we modelled the system adequacy as the share of wind energy is increased. Further, we enable the modelling of operating reserve capacities required for balancing services. The dynamics introduced through these model enhancements are presented in an application case study. This application indicates that introducing short-term constraints in long-term energy models may considerably influence the dispatch of power plants, capacity investments, and, ultimately, the policy recommendations derived from such models.']\n",

For the SC membrane, the detrimental effect of wetting can be alleviated by periodic drying to ensure a high CO&lt;inf&gt;2&lt;/inf&gt; removal efficiency (&gt;90%). Drying does not work for the PP membrane because the swelling of the PP fibers is irreversible. The SC membrane contactor exhibited a better anti-fouling ability than the PP membrane contactor because the superhydrophobic surface can self-clean. To ensure a continuous, high-efficiency CO&lt;inf&gt;2&lt;/inf&gt; removal, a method was proposed in which two-hollow fiber SC membrane contactors operate alternately with the addition of periodic drying. The SC hollow fiber membrane contactor shows great potential in real industrial CO&lt;inf&gt;2&lt;/inf&gt; post-combustion capture because of its good anti-wetting and anti-fouling features.']\n",

The angle of polarization may shift by Î\\xa0/2 for time-variable jets. The spectrum below the thermal peak of the polarized emission appears non-thermal due to aberration of light, without the need for additional radiative processes or energy dissipation. Furthermore, above the thermal peak a power law of photons forms due to Comptonization of photons that repeatedly scatter between regions of different Lorentz factor before escaping. We show that polarization degrees of a few tens of per cent and broken power-law spectra are natural in the context of photospheric emission from structured jets. Applying the model to gamma-ray bursts, we discuss expected correlations between the spectral shape and the polarization degree of the prompt emission.']\n",

This concept uses the stray inductance between the power device and the converter output as a filter component in combination with an additional small RC-link. Hence, a lossy, bulky, and costly filter inductor is avoided and the resulting output dv/dt is limited to 5-10 kV/mu s independent of the output current and switching speed of the SiC devices. As a consequence, loads with dv/dt constraints, e.g., motor drives can be fed from SiC devices enabling full utilization of their high switching speed. Moreover, a filter-model is proposed for the selection of filter component values for a certain dv/dt requirement. Finally, results are shown using a 300-A 1700-V SiC metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET). These results show that the converter output dv/dt can be limited to 7.5 kV/mu s even though values up to 47 kV/mu s weremeasured across the SiC MOSFET module.

Simulations of two hybrid combined cycles with pressurised fluidised bed combustion and CO<sub>2</sub> capture are presented. CO<sub>2</sub> is captured from pressurised flue gas by means of chemical absorption after the boiler but before expansion. The results show a CO<sub>2</sub> capture penalty of approximately 8 percentage points (including 90% CO<sub>2</sub> capture rate and compression to 110 bar), which makes the efficiency for the best performing cycle 43.9%. It is 5.2 percentage points higher than the most probable alternative, i.e. using a natural gas fired combined cycle and a pulverised coal fired condensing plant separately with the same fuel split ratio. The largest part of the penalty is associated with the lower mass flow of flue gas after CO<sub>2</sub> capture, which leads to a decrease in work output in the expander and potential for feed water heating. The penalty caused by the regeneration of absorbent is quite low, since the high pressure permits the use of potassium carbonate, which requires less regeneration heat than for example the more commonly proposed monoethanolamine. Although the efficiencies of the cycles look promising it will be important to perform a cost estimate to be able to make a fair comparison with other systems. Such a cost estimate has not been done in this study. A significant drawback of these hybrid cycles in that respect is the complex nature of the systems that will have a negative effect on the economy.']\n",

In total, 46 junctions from 22 carriers of balanced translocations were characterized. Genes were disrupted in 48% of the breakpoints; recessive genes in four normal carriers and known dominant intellectual disability genes in three affected carriers. Finally, seven candidate disease genes were disrupted in five carriers with neurocognitive disabilities (SVOPL, SUSD1, TOX, NCALD, SLC4A10) and one XX-male carrier with Tourette syndrome (LYPD6, GPC5). Breakpoint junction analyses revealed microhomology and small templated insertions in a substantive fraction of the analyzed translocations (17.4%; n = 4); an observation that was substantiated by reanalysis of 37 previously published translocation junctions. Microhomology associated with templated insertions is a characteristic seen in the breakpoint junctions of rearrangements mediated by error-prone replication-based repair mechanisms.

Extracellular loops in OMPs of Gram-negative bacteria are known to be highly variable. We examined the sequence diversity of Î²-barrel-encoding regions of tprC, tprD, and bamA in 31 specimens from Cali, Colombia; San Francisco, California; and the Czech Republic and compared them to allelic variants in the 41 reference genomes in the NCBI database. To establish a phylogenetic framework, we used T. pallidum 0548 (tp0548) genotyping and tp0558 sequences to assign strains to the Nichols or SS14 clades. We found that (i) Î²-barrels in clinical strains could be grouped according to allelic variants in T. pallidum subsp. pallidum reference genomes; (ii) for all three OMP loci, clinical strains within the Nichols or SS14 clades often harbored Î²-barrel variants that differed from the Nichols and SS14 reference strains; and (iii) OMP variable regions often reside in predicted extracellular loops containing B-cell epitopes. On the basis of structural models, nonconservative amino acid substitutions in predicted transmembrane Î²-strands of T. pallidum repeat C (TprC) and TprD2 could give rise to functional differences in their porin channels. OMP profiles of some clinical strains were mosaics of different reference strains and did not correlate with results from enhanced molecular typing. Our observations suggest that human host selection pressures drive T. pallidum subsp. pallidum OMP diversity and that genetic exchange contributes to the evolutionary biology of T. pallidum subsp. pallidum. They also set the stage for topology-based analysis of antibody responses to OMPs and help frame strategies for syphilis vaccine development. IMPORTANCE Despite recent progress characterizing outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of Treponema pallidum, little is known about how their surface-exposed, Î²-barrel-forming domains vary among strains circulating within high-risk populations. In this study, sequences for the Î²-barrel-encoding regions of three OMP loci, tprC, tprD, and bamA, in T. pallidum subsp. pallidum isolates from a large number of patient specimens from geographically disparate sites were examined. Structural models predict that sequence variation within Î²-barrel domains occurs predominantly within predicted extracellular loops. Amino acid substitutions in predicted transmembrane strands that could potentially affect porin channel function were also noted. Our findings suggest that selection pressures exerted within human populations drive T. pallidum subsp. pallidum OMP diversity and that recombination at OMP loci contributes to the evolutionary biology of syphilis spirochetes. These results also set the stage for topology-based analysis of antibody responses that promote clearance of T. pallidum subsp. pallidum and frame strategies for vaccine development based upon conserved OMP extracellular loops.']\n",

A thorough review on common measurement techniques as well as correction methods reveals, that there are a number of pitfalls, that-when not accounted for-can lead to wrong conclusions about the wall position and thereby also on the near-wall behaviour of mean and turbulence quantities. Employing the state-of-the-art databases from direct numerical simulations of wall-bounded turbulent flows various indirect methods have been tested and assessed in terms of their robustness and accuracy. It is also demonstrated that accurate measurements reaching the viscous sublayer are necessary in order to ensure a correctly deduced wall position, and dependent quantities as for instance the near-wall scaling of mean (e.g. Reynolds number dependence of the buffer region or the log law constants) and turbulence (e.g. the near-wall peak location of Reynolds stresses) quantities. In experiments using hot-wires near the wall it is well known that heat conduction between the hot-wire and the wall gives errors and mean velocity data from the viscous sublayer can usually not be used to determine the wall position. In this paper we introduce a new method which takes advantage of the similarity of the probability density distributions (pdf) in the near wall region. By using the high velocity data of the pdf, which is shown not to be affected by heat conduction, the heat conduction problem can be circumvented. Extensive appendices are included, describing the history and present knowledge about the scaling of the mean velocity in the near wall and overlap regions in wall bounded turbulent flows.']\n",

This approach has been generalized for channel and pipe flows as well, and it has been found that the deviation from the previously established linear region appears at a given wall distance in viscous units (around 120) for all three canonical flows. Based on these results, new empirical fits for the streamwise velocity turbulence intensity distribution of each canonical flow are proposed. Coupled with a mean streamwise velocity profile description the model provides a composite profile for the streamwise variance profile that agrees nicely with existing numerical and experimental data. Extrapolation of the proposed scaling to high Reynolds numbers predicts the emergence of a second peak of the streamwise variance profile that at even higher Reynolds numbers overtakes the inner one.']\n",

Several measurement stations downstream of the forest edge have been investigated and it is observed that, while the mean velocity profile adjusts quickly to the new canopy boundary condition, the turbulence lags behind and shows a continuous penetration towards the free stream along the canopy model. The statistical profiles illustrate this growth and do not collapse when plotted as a function of the vertical coordinate. However, when the statistics are plotted as function of the local mean velocity (normalized with a characteristic velocity scale), they do collapse, independently of the streamwise position and freestream velocity. A new scaling for the spectra of all three velocity components is proposed based on the velocity variance and integral time scale. This normalization improves the collapse of the spectra compared to existing scalings adopted in atmospheric measurements, and allows the determination of a universal function that provides the velocity spectrum. Furthermore, a comparison of the proposed scaling laws for two different canopy densities is shown, demonstrating that the vertical velocity variance is the most sensible statistical quantity to the characteristics of the canopy roughness.']\n",

Fluids, vol. 23, 2011, 041702) to assess the convergence towards a well-behaved zero-pressure-gradient (ZPG) turbulent boundary layer (TBL). The most popular and well-understood methods to assess the convergence towards a well-behaved state rely on empirical skin-friction curves (requiring accurate skin-friction measurements), shape-factor curves (requiring full velocity profile measurements with an accurate wall position determination) or wake-parameter curves (requiring both of the previous quantities). On the other hand, the proposed diagnostic-plot method only needs measurements of mean and fluctuating velocities in the outer region of the boundary layer at arbitrary wall-normal positions. To test the method, six tripping configurations, including optimal set-ups as well as both under- and overtripped cases, are used to quantify the convergence of ZPG TBLs towards well-behaved conditions in the Reynolds-number range covered by recent high-fidelity direct numerical simulation data up to a Reynolds number based on the momentum thickness and free-stream velocity of approximately 4000 (corresponding to 2.5 m from the leading edge) in a wind-tunnel experiment. Additionally, recent high-Reynolds-number data sets have been employed to validate the method. The results show that weak tripping configurations lead to deviations in the mean flow and the velocity fluctuations within the logarithmic region with respect to optimally tripped boundary layers. On the other hand, a strong trip leads to a more energized outer region, manifested in the emergence of an outer peak in the velocity-fluctuation profile and in a more prominent wake region. While established criteria based on skin-friction and shape-factor correlations yield generally equivalent results with the diagnostic-plot method in terms of convergence towards a well-behaved state, the proposed method has the advantage of being a practical surrogate that is a more efficient tool when designing the set-up for TBL experiments, since it diagnoses the state of the boundary layer without the need to perform extensive velocity profile measurements.']\n",

Numerical studies show that in the case of using the bi-linear surface negative variance components were come out, the bi-quadratic can model the difference better and delivers errors of 2.7 km and 1.5 km for the gravimetric and seismic models, respectively. These errors are 2.1 km and 1.6 km in the case of using the bi-cubic surface and 1 km and 1.5 km when the multi-quadric radial base function is used. The combined gravimetric models will be computed based on the estimated errors and each corrective surface.']\n",

      "[\"So far the recent Earth's gravity model, EGM08, has been successfully applied for different geophysical and geodetic purposes. In this paper, we show that the computation of geoid and gravity anomaly on the reference ellipsoid is of essential importance but error propagation of EGM08 on this surface is not successful due to downward continuation of the errors. Also we illustrate that some artefacts appear in the computed geoid and gravity anomaly to lower degree and order than 2190. This means that the role of higher degree harmonics than 2160 is to remove these artefacts from the results. Consequently, EGM08 must be always used to degree and order 2190 to avoid the numerical problems.\"]\n",

      "['The geoid error, computed from EGM08, is unrealistically large due to the continuation of the spherical harmonic coefficient errors down to the surface of the reference ellipsoid. In this study, we try to calibrate such an error by the differences between the EGM08 and GNSS/levelling geoids over Fennoscandia. We use the variance component estimation procedure through combined adjustments of the geoid and GNSS/levelling heights using corrector surfaces of 4-, 5- and 7-parameter. We also develop a simple iterative method to calibrate the geoid error from the a posteriori variance factor and the errors of GNSS/levelling geoid. Our numerical investigations show that performing the separate adjustment and variance component estimation for each country with a two component stochastic model is more successful than performing it in the whole area with a five-component model. The number of GNSS/levelling data over Sweden and Norway are much larger than those in Denmark and Finland. This causes that the corrector surfaces are fitted better in these countries and consequently the estimated errors for the geoid become larger than what they should be in the others. Based on a 7-parameter corrector surface model, the average error of the EGM08 geoid becomes 12,17, 51 and 34 mm, in Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland, respectively. If the two-component stochastic model is used in a combined adjustment over Fennoscandia this average error will be 48 mm.']\n",

First, a literature study aimed to review previous studies on the economics of ergonomics in general and within the maritime domain in particular; and moreover, to ascertain the key ergonomic factors addressed in contemporary maritime ergonomic research. Second, the concept of ergonomics was probed from a stakeholder perspective through nine semi-structured qualitative\\xa0 interviews. Third, structured interviews were held with representatives of ten Swedish shipping companies to investigate if the shipowners are aware of and calculate the economic effects of ergonomics.

Specifically, the spatial orientation of collagen fibers in the wall has a major impact on its mechanical properties. Apart from valuable microhistological information, this data can be integrated by histomechanical constitutive models thought to improve biomechanical simulations, i.e. to improve the biomechanical rupture risk assessment of AAAs. Tissue samples (n = 24) from the AAA wall were harvested during elective AAA repair, fixated, embedded, sectioned and investigated by polarized light microscopy. The birefringent properties of collagen were reinforced by picrosirius red staining and the three-dimensional collagen fiber orientations were identified with a universal rotary stage. Two constitutive models for collagen fibers were used to integrate the identified structural information in a macroscopic AAA wall model. The collagen fiber orientation in the AM wall was widely dispersed and could be captured by a Bingham distribution function (kappa(1) = 11.6, kappa(2) = 9.7). The dispersion was much larger in the tangential plane than in the cross-sectional plane, and no significant difference between the medial and adventitial layers could be identified. The layered directional organization of collagen in normal aortas was not evident in the AAA. The collagen organization identified, combined with constitutive descriptions of collagen fibers that depend on its orientation, explain the anisotropic (orthotropic) mechanical properties of the AAA wall. The mechanical properties of collagen fibers depend largely on their undulation, which is an important structural parameter that requires further experimental investigation.']\n",

      "['Background. The prevalence for thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) is significantly increased in patients with a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) compared with patients who have a normal tricuspid aortic valve (TAV). TAA rupture is a life-threatening event, and biomechanics-based simulations of the aorta may help to disentangle the molecular mechanism behind its development and progression. The present study used polarized microscopy and macroscopic in vitro tensile testing to explore collagen organization and mechanical properties of TAA wall specimens from BAV and TAV patients. Methods. Circumferential sections of aneurysmal aortic tissue from BAV and TAV patients were obtained during elective operations. The distribution of collagen orientation was captured by a Bingham distribution, and finite element models were used to estimate constitutive model parameters from experimental load-displacement curves. Results. Collagen orientation was almost identical in BAV and TAV patients, with a highest probability of alignment along the circumferential direction. The strength was almost two times higher in BAV samples (0.834 MPa) than in TAV samples (0.443 MPa; p &lt; 0.001). The collagen-related stiffness (C-f) was significantly increased in BAV compared with TAV patients (C-f = 7.45 MPa vs 3.40 MPa; p = 0.003), whereas the elastin-related stiffness was similar in both groups. A trend toward a decreased wall thickness was seen in BAV patients (p = 0.058). Conclusions. The aneurysmal aortas of BAV patients show a higher macroscopic strength, mainly due to an increased collagen-related stiffness, compared with TAV patients. The increased wall stiffness in BAV patients may contribute to the higher prevalence for TAAs in this group.']\n",

      "[\"Background: Mechanical characteristics of vascular tissue may play a role in different arterial pathologies, which, amongst others, requires robust constitutive descriptions to capture the vessel wall's anisotropic and non-linear properties.Specifically, the complex 3D network of collagen and its interaction with other structural elements has a dominating effect of arterial properties at higher stress levels.The aim of this study is to collect quantitative collagen organization as well as mechanical properties to facilitate structural constitutive models for the porcine carotid artery.This helps the understanding of the mechanics of swine carotid arteries, being a standard in clinical hypothesis testing, in endovascular preclinical trials for example. Method: Porcine common carotid arteries (n = 10) were harvested and used to (i) characterize the collagen fiber organization with polarized light microscopy, and (ii) the biaxial mechanical properties by inflation testing.The collagen organization was quantified by the Bingham orientation density function (ODF), which in turn was integrated in a structural constitutive model of the vessel wall.A one-layered and thick-walled model was used to estimate mechanical constitutive parameters by least-square fitting the recorded in vitro inflation test results.Finally, uniaxial data published elsewhere were used to validate the mean collagen organization described by the Bingham ODF. Results: Thick collagen fibers, i.e.the most mechanically relevant structure, in the common carotid artery are dispersed around the circumferential direction.In addition, almost all samples showed two distinct families of collagen fibers at different elevation, but not azimuthal, angles.Collagen fiber organization could be accurately represented by the Bingham ODF (kappa(1,2,3) = [13.5, 0.0, 25.2] and kappa(1,2,3) = [14.7, 0.0,26.6]; average error of about 5%), and their integration into a structural constitutive model captured the inflation characteristics of individual carotid artery samples.Specifically, only four mechanical parameters were required to reasonably (average error from 14% to 38%) cover the experimental data over a wide range of axial and circumferential stretches.However, it was critical to account for fibrilar links between thick collagen fibers.Finally, the mean Bingham ODF provide also good approximation to uniaxial experimental data. Conclusions: The applied structural constitutive model, based on individually measured collagen orientation densities, was able to capture the biaxial properties of the common carotid artery. Since the model required coupling amongst thick collagen fibers, the collagen fiber orientations measured from polarized light microscopy, alone, seem to be insufficient structural information. Alternatively, a larger dispersion of collagen fiber orientations, that is likely to arise from analyzing larger wall sections, could have had a similar effect, i.e. could have avoided coupling amongst thick collagen fibers. Statement of Significance The applied structural constitutive model, based on individually measured collagen orientation densities, was able to capture the biaxial and uniaxial properties of the common carotid artery. Since the model required coupling amongst thick collagen fibers, an effective orientation density that accounts for cross links between the main collagen fibers has been porposed. The model provides a good approximation to the experimental data.\"]\n",

Isotope fractionation (the change in its concentration) occurs in any thermodynamic reaction. The isotopic composition serves as a distinct mark for each water sample. To carry out the isotope analysis of pore water, which may be used to reveal the source of excessive water in building elements, firstly one has to extrude water from voids. For this we tested three different methods of retrieving water from the porous material: squeezing and evaporation - the direct methods, dilution - the indirect method. The influence of capillary suction on the hydrogen and oxygen isotopes abundance ratio was also analysed. Materials whose substantial part of voids are gel pores (cementitious materials) act as a membrane during isotope transport separating lighter from heavier isotopes and therefore cause the fractionation of isotopes. The results of performed experiments indicate that moisture transport (capillary suction) has an influence on the isotopic composition of water. Therefore the isotope analysis can be useful in the investigation of moisture behaviour of porous building materials.']\n",

      "[\"Context. GRB061122 is one of the brightest GRBs detected within INTEGRAL's field of view to date, with a peak flux (20-200 keV) of 32 photons cm(-2) s(-1) and fluence of 2 x 10(-5) erg cm(-2). The Spectrometer aboard INTEGRAL, SPI, can measure linear polarisation in bright GRBs through the process of Compton scattering in the Germanium detectors. Polarisation measurements of the prompt emission are relatively rare. The spectral and polarisation results can be combined to provide vital information about the circumburst region. Aims. The two gamma-ray detectors on INTEGRAL were used to investigate the spectral characteristics of GRB061122. A search for linear polarisation in the prompt emission was carried out on GRB061122 using the SPI multiple event data in the energy range 100 keV-1 MeV. The X-ray properties were examined using data from the X-Ray Telescope (XRT) on Swift. Methods. The gamma-ray spectral and temporal properties of GRB061122 were determined using IBIS and SPI. The afterglow properties were obtained using XRT. The multiple event data of GRB061122 from SPI were analysed and compared with the predicted instrument response obtained from Monte-Carlo simulations using the GEANT 4 INTEGRAL mass model. The chi(2) distributions between the real and simulated data as a function of the percentage polarisation and polarisation angle were calculated and limits on the level and angle of polarisation were obtained from the best-fit value of chi(2). Results. The prompt spectrum was best fit by a combination of a blackbody and a power-law model (the quasithermal model), with evidence for high energy emission continuing above 8 MeV. A pseudo-redshift value of pz = 0.95 +/- 0.18 was determined using the spectral fit parameters. The isotropic energy at this pseudo-redshift is 8.5 x 10(52) erg. The jet opening angle was estimated to be smaller than 2.8 degrees or larger than 11.9 degrees from the X-ray lightcurve. An upper limit of 60% polarisation was determined for the prompt emission of GRB061122, using the multiple event data from the spectrometer on INTEGRAL. Conclusions. The high energy emission observed in the spectrum may be due to the reverse shock interacting with the GRB ejecta when it is decelerated by the circumburst medium. This behaviour has been observed in a small fraction of GRBs to date, but is expected to be more commonly observed by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. The conditions for polarisation are met if the jet opening angle is less than 2.8 degrees, but further constraints on the level of polarisation are not possible.\"]\n",

The enzyme-flavin bond helps to increase the flavin's redox potential to facilitate substrate oxidation in several oxidases. The formation of the enzyme-flavin covalent bond-the flavinylation reaction-has been studied for the past 40 years. For the most advocated mechanism of autocatalytic flavinylation, the quinone methide mechanism, appropriate stabilization of developing negative charges at the flavin N(1) and N(5) loci is crucial. Whereas the structural basis for stabilization at N(1) is relatively well studied, the structural requisites for charge stabilization at N(5) remain less clear. Here, we show that flavinylation of histidine 167 of pyranose 2-oxidase from Trametes multicolor requires hydrogen bonding at the flavin N(5)/O(4) locus, which is offered by the side chain of Thr169 when the enzyme is in its closed, but not open, state. Moreover, our data show that additional stabilization at N(5) by histidine 548 is required to ensure high occupancy of the histidyl flavin bond. The combination of structural and spectral data on pyranose 2-oxidase mutants supports the quinone methide mechanism. Our results demonstrate an elaborate structural fine-tuning of the active site to complete its own formation that couples efficient holoenzyme synthesis to conformational substates of the substrate-recognition loop and concerted movements of side chains near the flavinylation ligand.

Deeper groundwater is defined here as non-brackish, potable (Cl- &lt;= 250 mg/L) groundwater available at the maximum accessed depth (similar to 80-300 m). The extent of elevated As in deeper groundwater in the study area seems to be largely controlled by the aquifer-aquitard framework.

Aquifer sediments are not abnormally enriched in As at any depth, but sediment and water chemistry are conducive to As mobilization in both shallow and deeper parts of the aquifer(s). The biogeochemical triggers are influenced by complex redox disequilibria. Results of numerical modeling and profiles of environmental tracers at a local-scale study site suggest that deeper groundwater abstraction can draw As-enriched water to 150 m depth within a few decades, synchronous with the advent of wide-scale irrigational pumping in West Bengal (India).']\n",

The hydrochemistry is dominated by HCO3- (208 to 440 mg/L), Ca2+ (79 to 178 mg/L) and Mg2+ (17 to 45 mg/L) ions along with high concentrations of As-T (As total, below detection limit to 0.29 mg/L), Fe-T (Fe total, 1.2 to 16 mg/L), and Fe(II) (0.74 to 16 mg/L). The result demonstrates that Fe(II)-Fe(III) cycling is the dominant process for the release of As from aquifer sediments to groundwater (and vice versa), which is mainly controlled by the local biogeochemical conditions.

Design/methodology/approach - In a random sample of 60 out of the 290 municipalities in Sweden, 15,871 municipal social care employees working with elderly and disabled clients were sent a questionnaire concerning psychosocial work environment, WHP, and self-rated health. The responses (response rate 58.4 per cent) were complemented by register data on sickness absence (&amp;amp;gt;14 days). All data were aggregated to employer level. Findings - A structural equation modelling analysis using employer-level data demonstrated that employers with more favourable employee ratings of the psychosocial work conditions, as well as of specific health-promoting measures, had better self-rated health and lower sickness absence level among employees. Practical implications - The results from this representative nationwide sample of employers within one sector indicate that employers can promote employee health both by offering various health-specific programmes and activities, such as work environment education, fitness activities, and lifestyle guidance, as well as by forming a high-quality work environment in general including developmental and supportive leadership styles, prevention of role conflicts, and a supportive and comfortable social climate. Originality/value - This study with a representative nationwide sample demonstrates: results in line with earlier studies and explanations to the challenges in comparing effects from specific and general WHP interventions on health.']\n",

The study examines the effects of heterogeneity and assortativity of customer revenue on the profit impact of negative word-of-mouth that is initiated by three groups of consumers-revenue leaders, social hubs, and experts. The authors explore these effects using an agent-based simulation modeling approach and an in-depth computational experiment with empirical input data regarding social connectivity from 10 consumer social networks. The results indicate that negative word-of-mouth is more damaging in markets where there is a higher degree of heterogeneity. Moreover, assortativity may significantly affect the profit impact of disappointments, but this effect depends on the initial percentage of disappointed adopters. The study also finds an interaction between heterogeneity and assortativity, such that the effect of heterogeneity increases as assortativity increases up to a moderate level of assortativity, then the effect of heterogeneity on profits remains relatively constant. The implications from these results suggest that marketing managers should consider the heterogeneity and assortativity characteristics of their customer revenue streams to (a) better manage the adverse profit impacts of customer disappointments and negative word-of-mouth; (b) design more effective customer loyalty programs; and (c) more efficiently manage their customer equity portfolios.']\n",

We consider that each agent is modeled as a discrete state-transition system and its task specification takes a form of a linear temporal logic formula. A traditional automata-based approach to multi-agent plan synthesis from such specifications builds on centralized team planning and full team synchronization after each agents' discrete step, and thus suffers from extreme computational demands. We aim at reducing the computational complexity by decomposing the plan synthesis problem into finite horizon planning problems that are solved iteratively, upon the run of the agents.

ILT is a porous diluted structure (biphasic solid-fluid material) and its impact on AAA biomechanics is controversially discussed in the literature. Specifically, pressure measurements showed that the ILT cannot protect the wall from the arterial pressure, while other (numerical and experimental) studies showed that at the same time it reduces the stress in the wall. Method: To explore this phenomenon further a poroelastic description of the ILT was integrated in Finite Element (FE) Models of the AAA. The AAA model was loaded by a pressure step and a cyclic pressure wave and their transition into wall tension was investigated. To this end ILT's permeability was varied within a microstructurally motivated range. Results: The two-phase model verified that the ILT transmits the entire mean arterial pressure to the wall while, at the same time, it significantly reduces the stress in the wall. The predicted mean stress in the AAA wall was insensitive to the permeability of the ILT and coincided with the results of AAA models using a single-phase ILT description. Conclusion: At steady state, the biphasic ILT behaves like a single-phase material in an AAA model. Consequently, computational efficient FE single-phase models, as they have been exclusively used in the past, accurately predict the wall stress in AAA models.\"]\n",

Multiple computational and experimental methods to avoid these errors in thin film measurements, in general, are discussed. Corrected absorptivity depends on the quantity of Si embedded in the SiC but is independent of the Si crystallinity, indicating a relaxation of the k-conservation criterion for optical transitions in the nanocrystals. Tauc gaps of 1.8-2.0 and 2.12 eV are determined for Si nanoclusters and SiC, respectively. PL spectra exhibit a red-shift of similar to 100 nm per nm nominal Si nanocluster diameter, which is in agreement with quantum confinement but revealed to be an artifact entirely due to Fabry-Perot interference. Several simple experimental methods to diagnose or avoid interference in PL measurements are developed that are applicable to all thin films. Corrected PL is rather weak and invariant with passivation, indicating that non-paramagnetic defects are responsible for rapid non-radiative recombination. They are also responsible for the broad, sub-gap PL of the SiC, and can wholly account for the form of the PL of samples with Si nanoclusters. The PL intensity of samples with Si nanoclusters, however, can only be explained with an increased density of luminescent defects in the SiC due to Si nanoclusters, efficient tunneling of photogenerated carriers from Si nanoclusters to SiC defects, or with emission from a-Si nanoclusters. Films prepared on Si exhibit much weaker PL than the same films prepared on quartz substrates.']\n",

The model has been implemented in a finite element software package for pseudo-binary PMBs and calibrated with experimental observations of three different PMBs. Parametric studies have been conducted. Simulation results indicate that all the investigated model parameters, including the mobility and gradient energy coefficients, interaction and dilution parameters, have specific effects on the phase separation process of an unstable PMB. In addition to the unstable cases, the model can also describe and predict stable PMBs. Moreover, the phase inversion phenomenon with increasing polymer content in PMBs is also well reproduced by the model. This model can be the foundation of an applicable numerical tool for prediction of PMB storage stability and phase separation behaviour.']\n",

      "['With the aim to understand the effect of thermal condition on phase separation in polymer-modified bitumen (PMB), this paper numerically investigates four PMB binders under five thermal conditions between 140 and 180\\xa0°C. Based on a phase-field model previously developed by the authors for PMB phase separation, the updated model presented in this paper uses temperature-dependent parameters in order to approach the concerned temperature range, including mobility coefficients, interaction and dilution parameters. The model is implemented in a finite element software package and calibrated with the experimental observations of the four PMBs. The experimental results are well reproduced by the model, and it is thus believed that the calibrated parameters can represent the four PMBs. The simulation results indicate that the model proposed in this paper is capable of capturing the stability differences among the four PMBs and their distinct microstructures at different temperatures. Due to the transition of some PMBs from the thermodynamically stable state at 180\\xa0°C to the unstable state at 140\\xa0°C, a homogenization process may occur during the cooling applied numerically. After the transition, the PMBs start to separate into two phases and gradually form the binary structures controlled by the temperature. It is indicated that the cooling rate slightly affects the final pattern of the PMB binary microstructure, although the process can be more complicated in reality due to the potential dynamic reasons.']\n",

      "['A coupled diffusion-“flow model by phase-field method is proposed in this paper with the goal of predicting the storage stability of polymer-modified bitumen (PMB). In this study, the incompressible Navier-“Stokes equations were coupled with a previously developed phase-field model for PMB phase separation. The coupled model was implemented in a finite element software package with experimentally calibrated parameters and reported data in the literature. Effects of the parameters (bitumen density and dynamic viscosity) that affected the gravity-driven flow and phase separation in PMB were evaluated at 180°C with the simulation results. The results indicate that the coupled diffusion-“flow model can predict the storage stability (and instability) of PMBs. A good correlation between the simulation results and the previously reported experimental results (storage stability tube test) was observed. The different gravity-driven phase separation behaviors of PMBs might have resulted from the different composition of the equilibrium phases in the PMBs as well as the different densities and dynamic viscosities of the individual components (polymer and bitumen). A bigger polymer-“bitumen density difference, a lower bitumen dynamic viscosity, or both caused a faster flow and separation in the PMB at storage temperature. The investigated variation of bitumen dynamic viscosity had a more significant influence than the investigated variation of bitumen density in this study, but this finding might depend on the specific values of the model parameters. With this study as a foundation, further experimental and numerical studies will be conducted to increase understanding of storage-stable PMB binders and to develop a more efficient test method for determining PMB storage stability.']\n",

      "['Aiming to quantitatively evaluate the microstructure of polymer-modified bitumen (PMB) for roads, this paper employs the two-dimensional fast Fourier transform(2D-FFT) to process the microscopic and numerical images of four PMBs. The related derivative parameters, including the characteristic frequency and wavelength, are computed from the 2D-FFT power spectrum. The results show that the absence/presence of a characteristic frequency (range) on the power spectrum can indicate the lack/existence of the corresponding periodical structural pattern(s) in the original PMB image. A lower characteristic frequency usually represents a coarser PMB microstructure while a higher one implies a finer PMB microstructure. The 2D-FFT method is thus valid for differentiating various PMB microstructures. The proposed method is also capable of quantitatively evaluating the effects of temperature and the temporal evolution of PMB microstructure during phase separation. As the separation continues, the decrease of characteristic frequency indicates the coarsening process of a PMB microstructure. Additionally, the numerical reproduction of the observed phase separation is evaluated with the same method. The quantitative comparison with the experimental results reveals that the simulations fairly reproduced the microscopy observation results despite some deviation. The proposed method provides a foundation for the microstructure-based modelling of PMB performance in the future.']\n",

Since no separation happened in the stable PMBs, research focus was placed on capturing and analysing the phase separation process in the unstable PMBs. A phase inversion phenomenon was observed in one unstable PMB during the phase separation, showing the possible viscoelastic effects. Furthermore, it is indicated that criteria only based on compositional parameters can give misleading predictions of PMB storage stability. New criteria still need to be defined. The potential approaches to PMB phase behaviour prediction are reviewed and exploratively discussed in the context of the four investigated PMBs. This leads to a further discussion on the possibility of having a thermodynamic approach to PMB phase behaviour prediction by looking into the free energy of PMB. The Flory-“Huggins theory provides a way to do this, upon the consideration of PMB as a pseudo-binary blend and some made assumptions. Free energy curves have the strength of giving more information like the equilibrium phase composition. In addition, some more aspects should be also considered for PMB phase behaviour prediction towards an applicable criterion.']\n",

Making use of a new analytical framework, this paper maps out the changing stages of China-™s urban transition and examines the components of urban growth underpinning it. It arrives at several notable findings. Rural to urban migration has been the dominant component of urban growth, followed by urban natural population increase and reclassification.

China is currently in the latter part of the accelerated stage of its urban transition, and is expected to enter the terminal stage by 2030.

As Nigeria forges ahead into the next chapter of its urban transition, there is an unmet need to take stock of past experiences, identify trends, and speculate on future growth trajectories. Taking advantage of recently available datasets from the United Nations and the Africapolis Project, this paper launches an inquiry into the nature and causes of Nigeria-™s rapid urban transition between 1960 and 2010. It disaggregates urbanization into its individual components of urban growth and calculates their contributions to the overall urban increment. Several notable findings are highlighted. Nigeria, which is considered a late urbanizer, is currently in the accelerated stage of its urban transition and is projected to enter the terminal stage by 2030. Urban natural population increase has been the dominant component of urban growth in the post-colonial period and will likely continue to be so in the immediate future. Despite this, policies aimed at stemming rural to urban migration appear to have been the preferred mechanism for lessening the pressures posed by the contemporary urban transition, suggesting a potential policy mismatch.']\n",

The calculations clearly show that in both the gas phase and water the OB molecule is highly flexible with a large amplitude for the twist angle motion. The average gas-phase dipole moment for OB doubles in water, something that concords with a strong increase of total charge on phenoxide and pyridinium rings. We also investigated the solvatochromic shift in the pi-pi* and n-pi* transitions by carrying out INDO/CIS calculations for the gas-phase and solution-phase configurations obtained from the CPMD and CP-QM/MM calculations with results that are in good agreement with available experimental values (J.

The focus of the present study is to investigate such changes between proteins and solvents, using as an illustrating example the structure and dynamics of 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) within haloalkane dehalogenase (HAD) as protein and within water as solvent. We have studied DCE within HAD using Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics calculations in a quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics set-up. We find that the C-Cl bond length is shorter in HAD when compared to solution phase value, whereas the net atomic charges and dipole moment are significantly larger than the solution phase values. In contradiction to the usual trend that molecules in the vicinity of the proteins are less polar, we report the observation that the protein environment indeed polarizes the DCE solute more than the water solvent. Furthermore, within the protein environment we do not observe any conformational transition between gauche and trans conformers, and the DCE remains in the more polar gauche conformer during the entire simulation time scale. However, the trans conformer interconverts to the gauche conformer spontaneously within 0.4 ps, which clearly indicates that the trans conformer is unstable within the HAD protein. In contrast, the scatter diagram of total Kohn-Sham energy and dihedral angle between Cl-C-C-Cl atoms shows that the gauche and trans conformers have comparable energies in water. Overall, the present calculations show the within the protein not only the structure of DCE is altered but also that the conformational interconversion dynamics is affected very much. To investigate the confinement effect on the conformational equilibrium, we have also carried out force-field molecular dynamics calculations which show that the population of trans conformer is significantly lower within the protein when compared to that in water solvent.']\n",

The absorption spectra were obtained using the intermediate neglect of differential overlap/spectroscopic-configuration interaction (INDO/CIS) method and were calculated for a multitude of configurations of the trajectory. The calculated lambda(max) for PB in gas phase was found to be about 535 nm, which is considerably lower than the lambda(max) reported for PB in nonpolar solvents.

The electronic excitation energies for PB computed in the presence of solvent molecules in an increasing number of solvation shells were calculated in a systematic way to evaluate their contributions to the solvatochrmic shift.

On the basis of the average bond length values and group charge distributions, we find that the SM molecule remains in a neutral quinonoid form in chloroform (a nonpolar solvent) while it transforms to a charge-separated benzenoid form in water (a polar solvent). Based on a quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical response technique, with different MM descriptions for the water environment, absorption spectra were obtained as averages over configurations derived from the CP-QM/MM simulations. We show that for SM in water the solute polarization plays a major role in predictions of the lambda(max) and solvatochromic shift and that once this effect is included the contributions from solvent polarization and intermolecular charge transfer become less important. For SM in chloroform and water solvents, we have also performed absorption spectra calculations using a polarizable continuum model in order to address its relative performance compared to the QM/MM response technique. In the case of SM in water, our study supports the notion that, in order to predict accurate absorption spectra and solvatochromic shifts, it is important to use a discrete description of the solvent when it, as in water, is involved in site-specific interaction with the solute molecule. The technique is thus shown to outperform the more conventional polarizable continuum model in predicting the solvatochromic shift.']\n",

The Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics (CPMD) technique is used for gas phase NR, whereas for NR in water solvent, a hybrid quantum mechanics-molecular dynamics (CPMD-QM/MM) approach has been utilized. For the configurations obtained from CPMD and CPMD-QM/MM, the absorption spectrum has been calculated using the INDO/CIS method as implemented in the ZINDO program. Different solvation shells for NR in water have been defined based on solute-all-atoms and solvent center of mass radial distribution function (g(r(X-O)) rdf). The electronic excitation energies for these solvation shells were calculated in a systematic way to evaluate their individual contributions. In addition, calculations of absorption spectra were performed for NR (excluding solvent molecules) obtained from CPMD-QM/MM calculations to isolate the contribution to the solvatochromic shift just due to solvent-induced geometrical change. Interestingly, this geometrical change in NR itself contributes as much as 50 nm to the solvatochromic shift. The calculated lambda(max) for gas phase is around 488 nm and is comparable to the values reported for NR in nonpolar solvents, whereas the inclusion of solvent molecules in the hydration shell yields a lambda(max) of 565 nm which contributes to almost 77 nm of the solvatochromic shift.

The change in lambda(max) due to inclusion of the fourth solvation shell is only 1 nm, indicating that the spectrum has converged with respect to the solvent effect.

Hereby we report a semiconductorionic heterostructure La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) and Sm-Ca co-doped ceria (SCDC) material possessing unique properties for new generation fuel cells using semiconductor-ionic heterostructure composite materials. The LSCF-SCDC system contains both ionic and electronic conductivities, above 0.1 S/cm, but used as the electrolyte for the fuel cell it has displayed promising performance in terms of OCV (above 1.0 V) and enhanced power density (ca. 1000 mW/cm(2) at 550 degrees C). Such high electronic conduction in the electrolyte membrane does not cause any short-circuiting problem in the device, instead delivering enhanced power output. Thus, the study of the charge separation/transport and electron blocking mechanism is crucial and can play a vital role in understanding the resulting physical properties and physics of the materials and device. With atomic level resolution ARM 200CF microscope equipped with the electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) analysis, we can characterize more accurately the buried interface between the LSCF and SCDC further reveal the properties and distribution of charge carriers in the heterostructures. This phenomenon constrains the carrier mobility and determines the charge separation and devices' fundamental working mechanism; continued exploration of this frontier can fulfill a next generation fuel cell based on the new concept of semiconductor-ionic fuel cells (SIFCs).\"]\n",

The effect of using glycerol as compatibilizer was also characterized. Water and oxygen transport parameters, mechanical properties, and comparative biodegradability tests were evaluated for the blends. From the results, the barrier properties to oxygen were only seen to improve at 0% RH and mostly for the PLA-EVOH blends, which furthermore showed a positive deviation from the rule of mixtures. At high relative humidity, the blends showed somewhat poorer barrier performance due to the comparatively higher improvement in barrier of the neat PLA at 80% RH. Interestingly, room temperature biodegradability testing suggested that low additions of the blending elements seemed to facilitate the biodegradability of the biopolyester.

Phase competition between the most effective strengthening NbC nanosized precipitates and the Laves-Fe2Nb phase was analyzed, and it was found that adjusting the Nb/C ratio in the steels could enable the precipitation of highly stable, fine NbC particles. In addition, the formation of detrimental sigma phases could be suppressed by lowering the Mo and Si content in the alloy.

It is efficient to use an integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) approach to tailor alloying and heat treatment for design of these alloys. The most promising physically based modelling of precipitation for this purpose at present is Langer-Schwartz-Kampmann-Wagner (LSKW) modelling within the CALPHAD framework.

Hence, we combine quantitative transmission electron microscopy and LSKW modelling to investigate the tempering of a martensitic stainless steel 15-5 PH at 500 degrees C. The microstructural characterization shows that the Cu precipitation and growth occur in three stages: i) Cu BCC, n) Cu 9R, and iii) Cu FCC, during tempering up to 1000 h. The modelling predictions of size, volume fraction and number density of precipitates are in good agreement with the experimental results.

This property of the PON can be exploited for node consolidation where multiple central offices are replaced by a single one covering a larger service area. Such node consolidation is being particularly driven by the need for network operational cost saving, and is offering significant challenges to PONs. The degree of node consolidation that can be achieved is limited by the reach of conventional PON systems. In order to achieve a larger degree of node consolidation, an extension of the PON reach, beyond the conventional 20 km, is required. This article addresses the challenges of the dynamic bandwidth allocation, where increased reach results in a degradation of DBA performance and quality of service support. This degradation is a consequence of the increased propagation delay of the DBA messages exchanged between different PON elements. A potential solution to the performance degradation is the introduction of a multi-threaded DBA. In this article, we examine for both Gigabit PON and Ethernet PON, the extent to which DBA performance degradation can be reduced by exploiting multi-threading. It is found that for both standards, multi-threading, if done properly, can be used to mitigate the performance degradation due to the increased reach.

      "['Logistics collaboration has emerged a prevalent strategy to mitigate challenge individuals and organizations encounter. A successful collaboration, however, depends on certain trustworthy behaviors partner exhibit. To that end, understanding aspects constituting behavioral uncertainty and mechanisms by which such aspects affect partner trust is a necessary. This necessity counts on emergent behavioral trust uncertainties, constituted by partner-™s actions and interactions occurring during collaboration. While this is a necessary requirement, most of the studies in the literature lack to take into account the influence of behavioral uncertainty on collaboration and partner trust. To that effect, this paper uncovers outlined limitation by establishing behavioral factors influencing partner trust in operational stage of logistics collaboration. To accomplish this objective, a systematic literature review (SLR) is deployed to consolidate research domains of logistics, supply chain, collaboration, and trust. SLR proceeds by defining a review protocol, followed by a search process conducted in 5 databases using 20 search terms on articles published between 2001 and 2015 inclusively. Among findings this SLR has revealed are four behavioral factors and thirteen criteria proposed to affect partner trust. Additionally, these factors constitute success and measurable criteria needed for empirical investigation which may employ experimental and/or case-study methods. Moreover, synthesized factors extend further an understanding of behavioral trust in ad hoc collaborative networks, a large part of which being supported by networks of humans and computers.']\n",

The empirical case is the project Math Coach, where K-12 students are coached by teacher students using instant messaging. This research is an adaptation of the community of inquiry model to an online coaching setting, which we refer to as a relationship of inquiry. The adapted model was used to gain a better understanding of the practice of online coaching by exploring the extent to which cognitive, social, and teaching presence exist in this case of online coaching. A relationship of inquiry survey was distributed to and answered by all active coaches (n=41). The adapted cognitive, social and teaching presence measures achieved an acceptable level of reliability. Differences between three presences, and their respective sub-categories, demonstrate a unique pattern of interaction between coaches and coachees in the online coaching environment. Findings suggest the online inquiry model fits as well for a relationship of inquiry as it does for a community of inquiry.

A special focus capitalizes on the impact of the click chemistry concept on dendrimer synthesis and the promise it has to successfully accomplish highly sophisticated dendrimers, both traditional as well as heterofunctional, in a minimum number of chemical steps.

Furthermore, the influence of several factors on the occurrence of sagittal trunk inclinations in nurses was investigated. Trunk postures were recorded for nine nursing home nurses from four German nursing homes and 18 hospital nurses from seven hospitals using the CUELA measurement system. A total of 79 shifts, 27 in nursing homes and 52 in hospitals, were analysed. All measurements were supported by video recordings. Specially developed software (WIDAAN 2.75) was used to synchronize the measurement data and video footage. The total duration of inclinations per shift was significantly affected by the working area (nursing home or hospital) with an increase of 25.3 min in nursing homes (95% confidence interval 2.4-48.2; P = 0.032). Another factor was the extent of personal basic care tasks performed by the nurses (P &lt; 0.001). Nursing home nurses worked about twice as long per shift in a forward bending position compared with hospital nurses (112 versus 63 min; P &lt; 0.001) and they assumed almost one-third more inclinations per shift (1541 versus 1170; P = 0.005). Nursing staff perform a large number of inclinations. The amount of time spent by nurses working in a forward bending position was highly dependent on the working area and the extent to which patients were in need of help. It is very likely that future preventive measures, focussing on reducing the huge amount of inclination, would reduce the physical stress in everyday nursing work substantially.']\n",

      "['Because of their widely generalized use in many industries, composites are the subject of many research campaigns. More particularly, the development of both accurate and flexible numerical models able to capture their intrinsically multiscale modes of failure is still a challenge. The standard finite element method typically requires intensive remeshing to adequately capture the geometry of the cracks and high accuracy is thus often sacrificed in favor of scalability, and vice versa. In an effort to preserve both properties, we present here an extended finite element method (XFEM) for large scale composite fracture simulations. In this formulation, the standard FEM formulation is partially enriched by use of shifted Heaviside functions with special attention paid to the scalability of the scheme. This enrichment technique offers several benefits since the interpolation property of the standard shape function still holds at the nodes. Those benefits include (i) no extra boundary condition for the enrichment degree of freedom, and (ii) no need for transition/blending regions; both of which contribute to maintaining the scalability of the code.Two different cohesive zone models (CZM) are then adopted to capture the physics of the crack propagation mechanisms. At the intralaminar level, an extrinsic CZM embedded in the XFEM formulation is used. At the interlaminar level, an intrinsic CZM is adopted for predicting the failure. The overall framework is implemented in ALYA, a mechanics code specifically developed for large scale, massively parallel simulations of coupled multi-physics problems. The implementation of both intrinsic and extrinsic CZM models within the code is such that it conserves the extremely efficient scalability of ALYA while providing accurate physical simulations of computationally expensive phenomena. The strong scalability provided by the proposed implementation is demonstrated. The model is ultimately validated against a full experimental campaign of loading tests and X-ray tomography analyzes.']\n",

This method works well for sandwich panels with isotropic cores but applications to panels with anisotropic cores are hard to find. Honeycomb is an example of anisotropic material which when used as a core, results in a sandwich panel with anisotropic properties. In this paper, honeycomb panels are treated as being orthotropic and the wavenumbers are calculated for the two principle directions. These calculated wavenumbers are validated with the measured wavenumbers estimated from the resonance frequencies of freely hanging honeycomb beams. A combination of wave propagation and standard orthotropic plate theory is used to predict the sound transmission loss of honeycomb panels. These predictions are validated through sound transmission measurements. Passive damping treatment is a common way to reduce structural vibration and sound radiation, but they often have little effect on sound transmission. Visco-elastic damping with a constraining layer is applied to two honeycomb panels with standard and enhanced fluid coupling properties. This enhanced fluid coupling in one of the test panels is due to an extended coincidence range observed from the dispersion curves. The influence of damping treatments on the sound transmission loss of these panels is investigated. Results show that, after the damping treatment, the sound transmission loss of an acoustically bad panel and a normal panel are very similar.']\n",

When operated in vacuum such liquid jets exhibit several non-classical instabilities that negatively influence the x-ray source's spatial and temporal stability, yield, and brightness, parameters that all are important for applications such as water-window microscopy. In the present paper, we investigate liquid-nitrogen jets with a flash-illumination imaging system that allows for a quantitative stability analysis with high spatial and temporal resolution. Direct and indirect consequences of evaporation are identified as the key reasons for the observed instabilities. Operating the jets in an approximately 100 mbar ambient atmosphere counteracts the effects of evaporation and produces highly stable liquid nitrogen jets. For operation in vacuum, which is necessary for the laser plasmas, we improve the stability by introducing an external radiative heating element. The method significantly extends the distance from the nozzle that can be used for liquid-jet laser plasmas, which is of importance for high-average-power applications. Finally, we show that laser-plasma operation with the heating-element-stabilized jet shows improved short-term and long-term temporal stability in its water-window x-ray emission.\"]\n",

The liquefied wood flour ester (PWF) showed good miscibility with PLA and good plasticization efficiency as shown by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and tensile testing. Tensile strain at break increased from a few percent for pure PLA to over 100 and 300% for the materials containing 10 and 30 wt-% of PWF. The addition of PWF accelerated the hydrolysis rate of PLA as shown by faster weight loss during aging in water and faster formation of water-soluble lactic acid oligomers, which was shown by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) analysis of the migrants. The liquefied rice bran based product (PRB) was not miscible with PLA and it did not improve the elongation at break of PLA. Rice bran is generally rich in arabinoxylans with only secondary less reactive alcohol groups. The larger number of un-reacted hydroxyl-groups in PRB was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and could explain the immiscibility with PLA.

This way, human task knowledge can be synthesised in a compact, effective representation suitable, for instance, to be subsequently transferred to a robot for imitation. The main contribution is the use of a robust framework capable of dealing with the uncertainty or incomplete data inherent to these activities, and the ability to represent behaviours at multiple levels of abstraction for enhanced task generalisation. Activity data from 3D video sequencing of human manipulation of different objects handled in everyday life is used for evaluation.

Yet, the -˜smart city-™ paradigm has been critiqued for favouring technological solutions and business interests over social inclusion and urban innovation. Despite the rhetoric of -˜citizen-centred approaches-™ and -˜user-generated data-™, the level of stakeholder engagement and public empowerment is still in question. It is unclear how smart city initiatives are developing common visions according to the principles of sustainable urban development. This paper examines how data governance in particular is framed in the new smart city agenda that is focused on sustainability. The challenges and opportunities of data governance in sustainability-driven smart city initiatives are articulated within a conceptual Framework on Sustainable Smart City Data Governance. Drawing on three cases from European countries and a stakeholder survey, the paper shows how governance of data can underpin urban smart and sustainable development solutions. The paper presents insights and lessons from this multi-case study, and discusses risks, challenges, and future research.']\n",

      "['Catchments are complex social-ecological systems involving multiple, and often competing, interests. Water governance and management regimes are increasingly embracing pluralistic, participatory, and holistic norms as a means to engage with issues of complexity, uncertainty, and value-conflicts. Integrated, participatory approaches are theoretically linked to improved learning amongst stakeholders across sectors and decision-making that is grounded in shared knowledge, experiences and scientific evidence. However, few studies have empirically examined the impacts of an integrated approach to learning and knowledge practices related to water resources.Here, a Swedish sub-catchment that has adopted such an approach in association with implementation of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) is examined. Interview-based analyses show that WFD implementation has both helped and hindered learning and knowledge practices surrounding both water planning and spatial planning. Whilst communities of practice have developed in the study area, a number of important challenges remain. These include the rigid goal-orientation of the WFD, the fragmentation of knowledge caused by an over-reliance on external consultants, as well as a lack of resources to synthesise information from multiple sources. Present results raise questions regarding the efficacy of the WFD to sufficiently enable the development of learning and knowledge practices capable of handling the complexity, uncertainties and value-conflicts facing catchments in Sweden and elsewhere.']\n"

      "['Three new sensitizers for photoelectrochemical solar cells were synthesized consisting of a triphenylamine donor, a rhodanine-3-acetic acid acceptor and a polyene connection. The conjugation length was systematically increased, which resulted in two effects: first, it led to a red-shift of the optical absorption of the dyes, resulting in an improved spectral overlap with the solar spectrum. Secondly, the oxidation potential decreased systematically. The excited state levels were, however, calculated to be nearly stationary. The experimental trends were in excellent agreement with density functional theory (DFT) computations. The photovoltaic performance of this set of dyes as sensitizers in mesoporous TiO<sub>2</sub> solar cells was investigated using electrolytes containing the iodide/triiodide redox couple. The dye with the best absorption characteristics showed the poorest solar cell efficiency, due to losses by recombination of electrons in TiO<sub>2</sub> with triiodide. Addition of 4-<em>tert</em> butylpyridine to the electrolyte led to a strongly reduced photocurrent for all dyes due to a reduced electron injection efficiency, caused by a 0.15 V negative shift of the TiO<sub>2</sub> conduction band potential.']\n",

      "['In the field of dye-sensitized solar cells, the number of different sensitizing dyes is increasing rapidly. To produce low-cost dyes, much work is being directed toward synthesizing all-organic, ruthenium-free dyes with high extinction coefficients and broad absorption bands with large solar spectrum overlap. One of the best dyes, the polyene-diphenylaniline dye D5L2A1, has a rather blue absorption with an IPCE onset at around 650 nm, but it still has an energy conversion efficiency of almost 6%. To increase the overlap with the solar spectrum, the cyanoacrylic acid anchoring group was changed to rhodanine-3-acetic acid in complex D5L2A3. This gave an IPCE onset at around 750 nm, but unfortunately, it also decreased the overall efficiency to a modest 1.7%. By femtosecond transient absorption, we show that the electron injections into TiO2 for the two dyes are ultrafast and indistinguishable with our time resolution (&lt; 200 fs). However, charge recombination is also ultrafast, with different fractions of a ca. 500-fs component for the two dyes. Yet, the fraction of the faster decay component is larger for D5L2A3 than for D5L2A1. Here, we provide an interpretation of the implications of changing anchoring group. We believe that a lack of electron density oil the binding oxygens of the D5L2A3 LUMO, due to the rhodanine group, promotes a higher probability for electron injection to short-lived surface trap states compared to the situation for the fully conjugated D5L2A1.']\n",

The photophysical and photochemical properties of the dye were analyzed both experimentally and theoretically. Terrylene-sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2 solar cells yielded good photocurrents providing more than 60% in external quantum efficiency. The photoinduced electron transfer from the dye to TiO2 was found to be very sensitive to conduction band edge shifts in TiO2 induced, either by changes in the composition of the redox electrolyte or by UV-illumination. This sensitivity was observed in quantum efficiencies for photocurrent generation of terrylene-sensitized solar cells and in photoinduced absorption experiments. The conduction band shifts were quantified using charge extraction methods. The observed sensitivity of the injection efficiency suggests that photoinduced electron transfer occurs from the relaxed excited state, possibly due to poor electronic coupling between TMIMA excited states and TiO2 conduction band states.']\n",

Solar cells sensitized with the dye N-719 were more efficient than the Z-907 cells, for all electrolytes studied. Adding a co-adsorbent, the amphiphilic hexadecylmalonic acid (HDMA), to Z-907 solar cells containing an organic-liquid electrolyte resulted in increased overall light-to-electricity conversion efficiencies, from 3.7% to 4.0%, (100 W m(-2), AM 1.5). Possibly, this is caused by an insulating hydrophobic barrier formed to suppress unwanted electron losses. By applying TiO2 (P25) nanoparticles, assumed to support electron transfer reactions, to the organic-liquid electrolyte, the conversion efficiency was increased from 4.1% to 4.6% (100 W m(-2), AM 1.5).

We have investigated the structure, especially the nature of orientational disorder of caffeine molecules as a function of temperature in the range of 400-550 K. Experimentally this system is known to undergo a phase transition at 426 K (considered to be an orientational order-disorder transition) and melt at 512 K. Our simulations reproduce these two transitions in excellent agreement with experiment. We find that the in-plane reorientational motion of molecules is restricted to small angles below 425 K, and above this temperature, molecules undergo essentially free rotations in molecular plane, and we find the melting to occur between 525 and 550 K. In the high temperature disordered phase, the disorder is mostly attributable to the in-plane orientational motion of the molecules. The potential energy profile for the in-plane reorientational rotation has six wells as a consequence of specific packing of molecules in the ab crystallographic plane. Also we find considerable out-of-plane reorientational disorder for the molecules in the high temperature disordered phase. We have also studied the structure and orientational disorder of the system that is quenched from 450 to 300 K. We find that in the quenched phase, the molecular orientational arrangement remains partially frozen. (C) 2009 American Institute of Physics. [DOI: 10.1063/1.']\n",

Based on our findings, we critically re-examine the computational procedures used for the determination of hyperfine coupling constants in general as well as the practice of using experimental hyperfine coupling constants as reference data when benchmarking and optimizing exchange-correlation functionals and basis sets for such calculations.']\n",

The overwhelming focus in the search for catalysing agents has been on compounds containing titanium, but the precise mechanism of their actions remains somewhat obscure. A recent experiment has now shown that fullerenes (C(60)) can also act as catalysts for both hydrogen uptake and release in lithium borohydride (LiBH(4)). In an effort to understand the involved mechanism, we have employed density functional theory to carry out a detailed study of the interaction between this complex metal hydride and the carbon nanomaterial. Considering a stepwise reduction of the hydrogen content in LiBH(4), we find that the presence of C(60) can lead to a substantial reduction of the involved H-removal energies. This effect is explained as a consequence of the interaction between the BH(x)(-) complex and the C(60) entity.']\n",

A new type of tendering contract, called \"Integrated Bridge Maintenance\", was introduced in one experimental area in Sweden.

The experiences and lessons from this pilot project are presented here, and analysed from a transaction cost perspective. An important feature of the contract was that it contained a combination of measures that should be carried out and properties of the bridges that the contractor was responsible to maintain. This created a balance between predictability and flexibility for the contractor. The client was satisfied because of increased competence and a low price. The latter can partly be explained by the possibility for the specialised bridge crew to get additional work from other sectors. One problem was that some properties were difficult to measure, which led to some controversies. As information about old bridges always are incomplete a partnering structure need to be built into the contract.

To motivate their participation, actors must expect some exclusive additional reward. This analysis leads to a suggestion that communicative planning may create social capital networks that offer valuable relational rewards, in varying amounts, to some or all interdependent stakeholders. The value of relational rewards is their potential to reduce transaction costs in future collective actions. The expectation of relational rewards may be a selective incentive powerful enough to counteract the social dilemmas inherent in communicative planning processes in pursuit of normative goals such as inclusiveness and diversity.

The deposition of particles in a horizontal channel may clog the flow path. The purpose of this paper is to extend the use of a developed Eulerian deposition model to liquid flows in horizontal straight channels to predict the particle deposition rate. For a horizontal pipe, the deposition rates may differ greatly along a cross section, due to the influences of gravity and buoyancy. The current deposition model is first applied to air flows to enable a comparison with available experimental data. Then, the model is applied to liquid flows in horizontal straight pipes. The effects of gravity, buoyancy, water flow rates, wall roughness, particle size and temperature difference in the near-wall boundary layer on the deposition rate have been studied and explained. The results show that the deposition rates of particles increase with an increased flow rate. The gravity separation has a large influence on the deposition of large particle at high and low parts of the horizontal pipe in some flows. Moreover, both the wall roughness and thermophoresis have a significant influence on the deposition rate of small particles. In addition, the roughness also shows an important influence on the large particle deposition at the top of the investigated pipe, due to that a large value of roughness can make the deposition location somewhat far away from the wall, where a stronger turbophoresis exists. The intensity of the turbophoresis relative to the gravity separation before a particle is reaching the deposition location is important for the large particle deposition when the gravity separation play a negative role on the deposition rate.

It is able to detect, react quickly to, and then follow up with considered responses to different kinds of user interruptions. The design of the rules which enable the ECA to respond intelligently to different types of interruptions was informed by manually analysed real data from human-human dialogue. The rules represent recoveries from interruptions as two-part structures: an address followed by a resumption. The system is robust enough to manage long, multi-utterance turns by both user and system, which creates good opportunities for the user to interrupt while the ECA is speaking.']\n",

We found that the visual intelligibility of the animated talker was on par with the real talker for the Lombard and whisper conditions.

When compared to the congruent normal speech condition, Lombard animation yields a significant increase in intelligibility, despite the AV-incongruence.

The modality combinations visual/haptic, visual/audio and visual/haptic/audio were compared in an experiment in which users solved a task together, working in pairs in adjacent rooms. The application used contained a flat surface in a 3D interface on which piles of cubes were randomly placed in a grid. The task involved scanning for empty cells and placing continuously falling cubes until all empty cells were filled. The cubes and the flat surface were designed in such a way that they could be felt and heard and thus could be recognized by different kinds of haptic and audio feedback cues. This made it possible to scan the environment and read both absolute and relative positions in the grid. A quantitative analysis of task performance and a qualitative analysis of video recordings and interview data were performed. Results showed that task completion times were significantly faster in the visual/haptic/audio condition compared with the other conditions and that there were also significantly fewer errors, result checks of one's own actions and double checks of the partner's actions in the visual/haptic/audio condition than in the other conditions. Qualitative results show that participants work simultaneously to a larger extent in the visual/haptic/audio condition and that less communication occurred in the visual/haptic/audio condition compared with the other conditions. We argue that more modalities improved the awareness of the environment resulting in the participants feeling more confident with their interaction in the environment in the visual/haptic/audio condition. This resulted in improved task performance. The visual/audio feedback was better suited for solving the task than the visual/haptic feedback even though haptic feedback gave a significant added value in the visual/haptic/audio condition.\"]\n",

Most studies of the robustness of PTN have focused on network topology and considered vulnerability in terms of connectivity reliability. While these studies provide insights on general design principles, there is lack of knowledge concerning the effectiveness of different strategies to reduce the impacts of disruptions. This paper proposes and demonstrates a methodology for evaluating the effectiveness of a strategic increase in capacity on alternative PTN links to mitigate the impact of unexpected network disruptions. The evaluation approach consists of two stages: identifying a set of important links and then for each identified important link, a set of capacity enhancement schemes is evaluated. The proposed method integrates stochastic supply and demand models, dynamic route choice and limited operational capacity. This dynamic agent-based modelling of network performance enables to capture cascading network effects as well as the adaptive redistribution of passenger flows. An application for the rapid PTN of Stockholm, Sweden, demonstrates how the proposed method could be applied to sequentially designed scenarios based on their performance indicators. The method presented in this paper could support policy makers and operators in prioritizing measures to increase network robustness by improving system capacity to absorb unexpected disruptions.']\n",

      "[\"Gas-phase heat transfer plays a critical role in many high temperature applications, such as preheaters, combustors, and other thermal equipment. In such cases common heat transfer augmentation methods rely on the convective component alone to achieve improved internal performance. Radiatively assisted heat transfer augmentation has been suggested as a way to overcome limitations in convective-only enhancement. One example of such a technique is the fiber array insert; thermal radiation emitted by tube walls is captured by a large number of slender fibers, which in turn convect heat to the flowing fluid. Previous numerical studies have indicated that this technique represents a promising enhancement method warranting further investigation. This paper presents results from an experimentally based feasibility study of fiber array inserts for heat transfer augmentation in an externally heated duct. Fibers composed of 140 mu m silicon carbide and 150 mu m stainless steel were assembled in arrays with porosities around 0.98, and were tested for empty-tube Reynolds numbers ranging from 17,500 to 112,500 and wall temperatures from ambient up to 750 degrees C. The arrays cause a significant pressure drop-roughly two orders of magnitude higher than the empty-tube case-but tube-side heat transfer coefficients were improved by up to 100% over the convective-only case in the low flow rate regime. The stainless steel fiber array exhibited similar heat transfer performance as the silicon carbide case, although pressure drop characteristics differed owing to variations in fluid-structure flow phenomena. Pressure drop data were roughly within the range of d'Arcy law predictions for both arrays, and deviations could be explained by inhomogeneities in fiber-to-fiber spacing. Heat transfer was found to depend nonlinearly on wall temperature and flow rate, in contrast to previously reported numerical data.\"]\n",

The simultaneous measurement on the same liquid film shows that the two techniques are in a good agreement with respect to accuracy, but the optical sensors have a much higher acquisition rate up to 30 kHz which is more suitable for rapid process.

Traditionally technical fibre flows are modelled as flow of fibres in a suspending medium. Here they are treated as crowded flows of fibre flocs from which the liquid may be squeezed in and out from. Compressive flows are common in the fibre-based process industry. They can e.g. be found in the head-box of a paper machine, in extruder nozzles in polymer technology, in the stirrer zone of mixers, etc. Traditionally such flows are analysed in elongational flow terms. Here it will be demonstrated that elongational and compressive flows for technical fibres suspensions differ qualitatively. The nature of technical fibre flocs is also discussed. For historic reasons they have come to be regarded as the outcome of a flocculation process of electrostatic-colloidal and/or mechanical-entanglement type. It will be shown that such a process is unnecessary for technical fibre suspensions and that these flocs are qualitatively different, viz. frozen-developed dissipative structures of the flocky fibre flow from which they originate. It will also be demonstrated that technical fibre flocs, in contrast with flocs of the chemically flocked type, are basically non-coherent, i.e. not kept together by themselves. It is this non-coherence that makes a compressive approach fruitful, for these economically important flows. An attempt to explain the reasons behind the present state of fibre flow theory is presented. The ambition is to stop to the present inproductive tradition in technical fibre flow.']\n",

The tensile strength of nanocomposite films prepared from the compartmentalized cellulosic nanofibers was 20% higher than that of pure BC sheets and wood cellulose nanopapers, and 60% higher than that of conventional BC/HEC blends, while no strain-to-failure decrease was observed.

Both beating the fibres and adding polyelectrolytes increased the in-plane strength, stiffness, and residual stresses of the paper sheets prepared. The fact that the residual stresses did not scale linearly with the stiffness of the prepared sheets suggests that both beating and polyelectrolyte addition made the fibre/fibre joints transfer load at a lower solids content, such that stresses were transferred between fibre layers in the sheet earlier in the drying process, thus increasing the residual stresses. The fact that the strength gain when building polyelectrolyte multilayers induced less residual stresses than when the strength was increased by beating indicates the possibilities for producing paper with high strength but less residual stress.']\n",

This paper investigates the nanofibril orientation distribution of films of partly oriented cellulose nanofibrils. Stripes of hydrogel films were subjected to different amount of strain and, after drying, examined with X-ray diffraction to obtain the orientation of the nanofibrils in the films, caused by the stretching. The cellulose nanofibrils had initially a random in-plane orientation in the hydrogel films and the strain was applied to the films before the nanofibrils bond tightly together, which occurs during drying. The stretching resulted in a reorientation of the nanofibrils in the films, with monotonically increasing orientation towards the load direction with increasing strain. Estimation of nanofibril reorientation by X-ray diffraction enables quantitative comparison of the stretch-induced orientation ability of different cellulose nanofibril systems. The reorientation of nanofibrils as a consequence of an applied strain is also predicted by a geometrical model of deformation of nanofibril hydrogels. Conversely, in high-strain cold-drawing of wet cellulose nanofibril materials, the enhanced orientation is promoted by slipping of the effectively stiff fibrils.']\n",

This results in grain refinement on the shiny side, an increase in local grain misorientation and in internal stresses on both the shiny and the matte side, and a reduction in their internal stress difference. At strong convection conditions and with gelatin present, copper deposits as strip-like grains along the centrifugal direction of the cross section, and finally forms a spiral-shaped pattern on the matte side. The causes of these features are discussed in detail. The combined influences of hydrogen and gelatin adsorption are further elaborated in a model for a copper deposition.

We report experimental and theoretical characterizations of dynamic optical properties of multi-shell-coated CdSe/CdS/ZnS QDs. Quantum-mechanical studies of fundamental optical excitations and Monte Carlo simulations of energy relaxation mechanisms indicate that the excitonic states are densely compacted in the QDs and are easily photoexcited by the laser pulse in the presence of nonradiative electron-phonon interactions. For spherical QDs, the decay time of spontaneous radiative emission of individual photoexcited excitonic states with zero angular momenta is found to be only tens of picoseconds. In our multi-shell QDs, high-energy excitonic states of nonzero angular momenta have to go through a number of nonradiative electron-phonon interaction steps in order to relax to zero-angular-momentum excitonic states for radiative emission, resulting in an effective fluorescence peak at about 2 ns in the photoncount-time relationship. This explains the measured long average fluorescence lifetime of 3.6 ns. Such a long lifetime facilitates the applications of colloidal QDs in areas such as QD-based solar cells, bioimaging and metamaterials.']\n",

Once formed, this metallic gallium can be difficult to remove. it has a strong influence on the Fermi level position in the band gap and poses a problem for subsequent epitaxial growth on the surface. We present a method of removing metallic gallium from moderately damaged GaN surfaces by deposition of indium, and formation of an In-Ga alloy that can be desorbed by annealing at similar to 550 degrees C. After the In-Ga alloy has desorbed, photoemission spectra show that the Ga3d bulk component becomes narrower indicating a smoother and more homogeneous surface. This is also reflected in a sharper low energy electron diffraction pattern. On heavily damaged GaN surfaces, caused by hard sputtering, larger amount of metallic gallium forms after annealing at 600 degrees C. This gallium readily alloys with deposited indium, but the alloy does not desorb until a temperature of 840 degrees C is reached and even then, traces of both indium and metallic gallium could be found on the surface.']\n",

It is found that once the quantum well is etched through, additional etching reduces the carrier lifetimes from 800 to 70 ps. The surface recombination velocity (SRV) at the exposed hole sidewalls is determined from the measured carrier lifetimes of the PhC fields with different lattice parameters. The observed variation in the SRV with etch duration also confirms the presence of accumulated sidewall damage. It increases from 6x10(3) to 1.2x10(5) cm s(-1) as the etching time increases from 3 to 50 min. A geometric model based on sputtering theory and on the evolution of the hole shape is developed to explain the accumulation of sidewall damage. The model is used to estimate the number of impact events from sputtered species reaching the QW sidewalls, and the variation in the accumulated impact events with etch duration is shown to be qualitatively consistent with the experimental observations. Finally, the results suggest a new method for tailoring the carrier lifetimes in PhC membrane structures.']\n",

To keep the K-ratio (the ratio between the film thickness and the surface roughness) intact, more effort must be put on the surface topography. This paper presents a study of how running-in affects the dry elastic contact area ratio in spur gears using real surface topographies from three common manufacturing methods (green-shaving, honing, and grinding). The test gears were manufactured in case-hardened steel, similar to 20MnCrS5. Surface topography measurements were used as input to a contact analysis boundary element software program. An important hypothesis used in this work is that the dry elastic contact area ratio, i.e. the ratio between real and nominal contact area, can be used as a measure of the contact conditions in gears. It is concluded that running-in differs significantly for the studied manufacturing methods and that the dry elastic contact area ratio gives a consistent description of these changes. The shaved gears have the highest dry elastic contact area ratio after running in, where the ground gears have the lowest dry elastic contact area ratio. The increase in dry elastic contact area ratio is about 30 per cent for the shaved gears, 12 per cent for the honed gears and less than 5 per cent for the ground gears. Extreme value parameters, such as R(p) and R(z), showed relatively good correlation to dry elastic contact area ratio. However no genuine correlation could be found between dry elastic contact area ratio and two-dimensional (2D) surface roughness parameters. Furthermore, traditional gear metrology form parameters do not serve as a good measure on the changes occurring during the running-in.']\n",

The results indicate that the interactions between different surface finishes and lubricants have different impacts on friction behaviour, wear and the reacted surface boundary layer formed by the lubricant. Running a smooth (polished) surface with the appropriate lubricant drastically reduces the friction. Surface analysis of the ground surfaces gives clear differences in lubricant characteristics.

As demonstrated for cortical FS interneurons, these gap junctions in the striatum may cause synchronized spiking, which would increase the influence that FS neurons have on spiking by the striatal medium spiny (MS) neurons. Dysfunction of the basal ganglia is characterized by changes in synchrony or periodicity, thus gap junctions between FS interneurons may modulate synchrony and thereby influence behavior such as reward learning and motor control. To explore the roles of gap junctions on activity and spike synchronization in a striatal FS population, we built a network model of FS interneurons. Each FS connects to 30-40% of its neighbors, as found experimentally, and each FS interneuron in the network is activated by simulated corticostriatal synaptic inputs. Our simulations show that the proportion of synchronous spikes in FS networks with gap junctions increases with increased conductance of the electrical synapse; however, the synchronization effects are moderate for experimentally estimated conductances. Instead, the main tendency is that the presence of gap junctions reduces the total number of spikes generated in response to synaptic inputs in the network. The reduction in spike firing is due to shunting through the gap junctions; which is minimized or absent when the neurons receive coincident inputs. Together these findings suggest that a population of electrically coupled FS interneurons may function collectively as input detectors that are especially sensitive to synchronized synaptic inputs received from the cortex.']\n",

The HWS line chickens are compulsive feeders, whereas, in the LWS line, some individuals are anorexic and others have very low appetites. The involvement of the central nervous system in these behavioural differences has been experimentally supported. We compared a brain region at 0 and 56 days of age containing the major metabolic regulatory regions, including the hypothalamus and brainstem, using a global cDNA array expression analysis.

Genes involved in lipid metabolism were over-represented among differentially expressed genes. The expression data confirm that neural systems regulating feeding behaviours in these lines are different. The results suggest that the lines are set in separate developmental trajectories equipped with slightly different nervous systems.

Feedforward inhibition of medium-sized spiny projection neurons in the striatum by fast-spiking interneurons is supposed to be an important determinant of controlling striatal output to later stages of the basal ganglia[1]. Striatal fast-spiking interneurons, which constitute approximately 1-“2% of all striatal neurons, show many similarities to cortical fast-spiking cells. In response to somatic current injection, for example, some of these neurons exhibit spike bursts with a variable number of action potentials (so called stuttering)[2-4]. Interestingly, the membrane potential between such stuttering episodes oscillates in the range of 20-“100 Hz[3,5]. The first spike of each stuttering episode invariably occurs at a peak of the underlying subthreshold oscillation. In both cortex and striatum, fast-spiking cells are inter-connected by gap junctions[6,7]. In vitro measurements as well as theoretical studies indicate that electrical coupling via gap junctions might be able to promote synchronous activity among these neurons[6,8]. Here we investigate the possible role of subthreshold oscillations on the synchronization of sub- and suprathreshold activity in a model of electrically coupled fast-spiking neurons. We use the model of Golomb et al.[3], which we extended with a dendritic tree so as to be able to simulate distal synaptic input. We show that gap junctions are able to synchronize subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations in response to somatic current injection. However, the oscillations are only prevalent in the subthreshold range and therefore require enough membrane potential depolarization[5]. In response to synaptic input, our model neuron only enters the subthreshold oscillatory regime with AMPA and NMDA synapses located at distal dendrites. Proximal synaptic input leads to more random fluctuations of the membrane potential, reflecting a smaller extent of dendritic filtering of the Poisson-distributed postsynaptic potentials. We furthermore investigate the effect of GABAergic (i.e. inhibitory) input to the model of the fast-spiking neuron and predict that inhibitory input is able to induce a stuttering episode in these cells. We finally discuss our results in the context of the feedforward inhibitory network, which is likely to play an important role in striatal and basal ganglia function.']\n",

Models in which the selection mechanism is kept constant are much more plausible in this case than what they are in general. One such model, namely uniform specified meet contraction, has the advantage of being closely connected with the AGM model. Its properties seem fairly adequate for the intended type of contraction. However, the revision operator based on it via the Levi identity collapses into an implausible operation that loses all old information when revising by new information. A weaker version, semi-uniform specified meet contraction, avoids the collapse but has the disadvantage of a remarkably weak logic. It is left as an open issue whether there is an intermediate class of contraction operators that yields a more satisfactory logic.']\n",

      "[\"The developmental dynamics of multicellular organisms is a process that takes place in a multi-stable system in which each attractor state represents a cell type, and attractor transitions correspond to cell differentiation paths. This new understanding has revived the idea of a quasi-potential landscape, first proposed by Waddington as a metaphor. To describe development, one is interested in the 'relative stabilities' of N attractors (N &gt; 2). Existing theories of state transition between local minima on some potential landscape deal with the exit part in the transition between two attractors in pair-attractor systems but do not offer the notion of a global potential function that relates more than two attractors to each other. Several ad hoc methods have been used in systems biology to compute a landscape in non-gradient systems, such as gene regulatory networks. Here we present an overview of currently available methods, discuss their limitations and propose a new decomposition of vector fields that permits the computation of a quasi-potential function that is equivalent to the Freidlin-Wentzell potential but is not limited to two attractors. Several examples of decomposition are given, and the significance of such a quasi-potential function is discussed.\"]\n",

The parametric study is carried out using a detailed 3-D model of a PCB slot. The detailed model was experimentally validated in a previous paper by the authors. Seven parameters were investigated: velocity, inlet height, screen porosity, PCB thickness, distance between two PCBs, inlet-screen gap and screen thickness. A correlation for the static anddynamic pressure drop, the percentage of dimensionless wetted area, A<sub>w</sub>*, and the RMS* factor (a function of the flow uniformity along the PCB) after the screen is reported as a function of six geometrical dimensionless parameters and the Reynolds number. The correlations, that are based on 174 three dimensional simulations, yield good results for the total pressure drop, in which the values are predicted within the interval of ±15%. For the, A<sub>w</sub>* all the predicted values are within the interval of ±22% of the observed values. Finally, for the RMS* factor, the majority of the values also have a disagreement of less than 20% of the observed values. These last two parameters are believed to provide a correct insight about the flow pattern after the screen.']\n",

The acceleration is studied in the extremely wide range of flame front velocity changing by 3 orders of magnitude during the process. Flame accelerates from realistically small initial velocity (with Mach number about 10(-3)) to supersonic speed in the reference frame of the tube walls. It is shown that flame acceleration undergoes three distinctive stages: (1) initial exponential acceleration in the quasi-isobaric regime, (2) almost linear increase in the flame speed to supersonic values, and (3) saturation to a stationary high-speed deflagration velocity. The saturation velocity of deflagration may be correlated with the Chapman-Jouguet deflagration speed. The acceleration develops according to the Shelkin mechanism. Results on the exponential flame acceleration agree well with previous theoretical and numerical studies. The saturation velocity is in line with previous experimental results. Transition of flame acceleration regime from the exponential to the linear one, and then to the constant velocity, happens because of gas compression both ahead and behind the flame front.']\n",

The cooling of the charged air results in higher density and thus volumetric efficiency. It is also important for petrol engines that the knock margin increases with reduced charge air temperature. A property that is still not very well investigated is the sound transmission through a CAC. The losses, due to viscous and thermal boundary layers as well as turbulence, in the narrow cooling tubes result in frequency dependent attenuation of the transmitted sound that is significant and dependent on the flow conditions. Normally, the cross-sections of the cooling tubes are neither circular nor rectangular, which is why no analytical solution accounting for a superimposed mean flow exists. The cross-dimensions of the connecting tanks, located on each side of the cooling tubes, are large compared to the diameters of the inlet and outlet ducts. Three-dimensional effects will therefore be important at frequencies significantly lower than the cut-on frequencies of the inlet/outlet ducts. In this study the two-dimensional finite element solution scheme for sound propagation in narrow tubes, including the effect of viscous and thermal boundary layers, originally derived by Astley and Cummings [Wave propagation in catalytic converters: Formulation of the problem and finite element scheme, Journal of Sound and Vibration 188 (5) (1995) 635-657] is used to extract two-ports to represent the cooling tubes. The approximate solutions for sound propagation, accounting for viscothermal and turbulent boundary layers derived by Dokumaci [Sound transmission in narrow pipes with superimposed uniform mean flow and acoustic modelling of automobile catalytic converters, Journal of Sound and Vibration 182 (5) (1995) 799-808] and Howe [The damping of sound by wall turbulent shear layers, Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 98 (3) (1995) 1723-1730], are additionally calculated for corresponding circular cross-sections for comparison and discussion. The two-ports are thereafter combined with numerically obtained multi-ports, representing the connecting tanks, in order to obtain the transmission properties for the charged air when passing the complete CAC. An attractive formalism for representation of the multi-ports based on the admittance relationship between the ports is presented. From this the first linear frequency domain model for CACs, which includes a complete treatment of losses in the cooling tubes and 3D effects in the connecting tanks is extracted in the form of a two-port. The frequency dependent transmission loss is calculated and compared to the corresponding experimental data with good agreement.']\n",

The pure components in the Surrogate fuels consisted of n-heptane, isooctane, toluene, ethanol and diisobutylene and fuel sensitivities (RON-MON) in the fuel blends ranged from two to nine. The operating conditions for the engine were p(in) = 0.1 and 0.2 MPa, T-in = 80 and 250 degrees C, phi = 0.25 in air and engine speed 1200 rpm. A semidetailed chemical kinetic model (142 species and 672 reactions) for gasoline surrogate fuels, validated against ignition data from experiments conducted in shock tubes for gasoline Surrogate fuel blends at 1.0 &lt;= p &lt;= 5.0 MPa, 700 &lt;= T &lt;= 1200 K and 0 = 1.0, was successfully used to qualitatively predict the HCCI experiments using a single zone modeling approach. The fuel blends that had higher fuel sensitivity were more resistant to autoignition for low intake temperature and high intake pressure and less resistant to autoignition for high intake temperature and low intake pressure. A sensitivity analysis shows that at high intake temperature the chemistry of the fuels ethanol, toluene and diisobutylene helps to advance ignition. This is consistent with the trend that fuels with the least Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) behavior show the highest octane sensitivity, and become less resistant to autoignition at high intake temperatures. For high intake pressure the sensitivity analysis shows that fuels in the fuel blend with no NTC behavior consume OH radicals and acts as a radical scavenger for the fuels with NTC behavior. This is consistent with the observed trend of an increase in RON and fuel sensitivity. With data from shock tube experiments in the literature and HCCI modeling in this work, a correlation between the reciprocal pressure exponent oil the ignition delay to the fuel sensitivity and volume percentage of single-stage ignition fuel in the fuel blend was found. Higher fuel sensitivity and single-stage fuel content generally gives a lower value of the pressure exponent. This helps to explain the results obtained while boosting the intake pressure in the HCCI engine.']\n",

Finally the chemical kinetic simulations were combined with a quasi-dimensional engine model in order to predict autoignition in octane rating tests. Our results suggest that the chemical origin of octane sensitivity in gasoline/nitroalkane blends cannot be fully explained on the conventional basis of the extent to which NTC behaviour is absent.

Hot needle injection improves the repeatability of the sample transfer but suffers from in-needle discrimination. Injection with a fast autosampler, resulting in minimal heating of the needle, solves this problem but usually requires a glass wool packing in the inlet liner to assist in vaporization of the sample. As glass wool has been reported to cause degradation of labile analytes, it cannot be applied as a general remedy for improving incomplete vaporization.

In commercial molecular simulation software, a wide variety of such combinations are available, and there is a need for critical assessment of the capabilities of the different alternatives. In the present work, the performance of several molecular mechanics force fields combined with different methods for the assignment of atomic point charges have been examined with regard to their ability to calculate absolute crystal lattice energies and their capacity to identify the experimental structure as a minimum on the potential energy hypersurface. Seven small, aromatic monomolecular crystalline compounds are used in the evaluation. It is found that the majority of the examined methods cannot be used to reliably predict absolute lattice energies. The most promising results were obtained with the Pcff force field using integral charges, and the Dreiding force field using Gasteiger charges, both of which performed with an accuracy of the same order of magnitude as the variations in experimental lattice energies. Overall, it has been observed that the best results are achieved if the same force field method is used to relax the crystal structure and calculate the energy, and to optimize and calculate the energy of the gas phase molecule used for the correction for changes in molecular geometry. The Pcff and Compass force fields with integral charges have been found to predict relaxed structures closest to the experimental ones.

      "['A whistler is a very low frequency (VLF) phenomenon that acquires its characteristics from dispersive propagation in the magnetosphere. Whistlers are derived from the intense VLF radiation produced in lightning strikes, which can travel great distances within the Earth-ionosphere waveguide (EIWG) before penetrating the ionosphere, and exciting a duct. Field-aligned ducts of enhanced plasma density guide the propagation from one hemisphere to the other. The location of the duct, relative to the strike that causes the whistler, is unknown. Whistler time series from Tihany, Hungary, have been cross-correlated with lightning data obtained from the World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN). The results show that whistlers observed at Tihany originate mainly from lightning strikes in an area with a radius of approximately 1 000 km surrounding the magnetic conjugate point in the Indian Ocean just east of East London, South Africa. A clear diurnal distinction was seen in that the correlation is maximised when the whistler station and the source region are in darkness. This is believed to relate to the diurnal variation of the ionosphere, which becomes more transparent to VLF waves at night.']\n",

In particular we investigate structures within large-scale arcs for which the particle signatures are made up of a group of multiple distinct thin arcs. These cases are chosen without regard to IMF orientation and are part of a group of 87 events where DMSP F13 SSJ/4 measures emissions which occur near the noon-midnight meridian and are spatially separated from both the dawnside and duskside auroral ovals by wide regions with precipitating particles typical of the polar cap. For 73 of these events the high-latitude aurora consists of a continuous region of precipitating particles. We focus on the remaining 14 of these events where the particle signatures show multiple distinct thin arcs. These events occur during northward or weakly southward IMF conditions and follow a change in IMF B-y. Correlations are seen between the field-aligned currents and plasma flows associated with the arcs, implying local closure of the FACs. Strong correlations are seen only in the sunlit hemisphere. The convection associated with the multiple thin arcs is localized and has little influence on the large-scale convection. This also implies that the sunward flow along the arcs is unrelated to the overall ionospheric convection.']\n",

The azimuthal direction of the phase velocity coincides with that of the cloud.

Inhomogeneities in the magnetosheath plasma, here called plasmoids, can impact the magnetopause and doing so set up a polarizing field that allows it to penetrate the magnetopause and enter the magnetosphere. A set of simulations of plasmoids with different dimensions is presented in this paper. For plasmoids that are longer than those previously published, waves propagating upstream from the barrier are found. It is also found that the penetration process causes the part of the plasmoid that is upstream of the barrier to rotate. The role of plasmoid width and cross sectional shape in penetration is studied, and for plasmoids that are less than half an ion gyroradius wide, the plasmoid is compressed to obtain a vertically oriented elliptical cross section, regardless of the initial shape. When the initial plasmoid width exceeds the ion gyroradius, the plasmoid still penetrates through a mechanism involving a potential that propagates upstream from the magnetic barrier.\"]\n",

Road pricing is one example of a theoretically well-developed transport policy measure that has proven notoriously difficult to decide and implement. There are however lessons to learn from practice on how to manage barriers to policy formation and implementation also within this field. Drawing on the congestion charging schemes implemented in London in 2003 and Stockholm in 2006, and the Swiss Heavy Vehicle Fee scheme implemented in 2001, this paper identifies a selection of strategies which appear to have supported the policymakers' capacity to implement effective road pricing schemes. Together, these three examples offer a sound empirical basis from which to infer a set of strategies for the formulation and implementation of politically-contentious road pricing packages addressing issues of measure combination, flexibility, legitimacy, communication, timing and organisational dynamics.

These orthogonal, non-parametric functions can be fitted with any desired mathematical structure, thus facilitating its implementation. Furthermore, due to the orthogonality, the non-parametric functions can be analyzed and discarded individually, which simplifies pruning basis functions and provides a tradeoff between complexity and performance.

The use of a WAPOD is only justified when its response outperforms that of a controller using local inputs. Therefore, the total time delay in the control loop must be below the calculated ETD.

Both manifest themselves through quiescent periods interrupted by periodic collapses. For both, large collapses, following long quiescent periods, have detrimental effects while short periods are associated with decreased confinement. Following the installation of the all metal -™ITER like wall-™ on JET, sawteeth and ELMs also play an important role by expelling tungsten from the core and edge of the plasma respectively. Control of tungsten has therefore been added to divertor heat load reduction, NTM avoidance and helium ash removal as reasons for requiring ELM and sawtooth control. It is therefore of interest to implement control systems to maintain the sawtooth and ELM frequencies in the desired ranges. On JET, ELM frequency control uses radial field -™kicks-™ and pellet and gas injection as actuators, while sawtooth control uses ion cyclotron resonance heating (ICRH). JET experiments have, for the first time, established feedback control of the ELM frequency, via real time variation of the injected gas flow [1]. Using this controller in conjunction with pellet injection allows the ELM frequency to be kept as required despite variations in pellet ELM triggering efficiency. JET Sawtooth control experiments have, for the first time, demonstrated that low field side ICRH, as foreseen for ITER, can shorten sawteeth lengthened by central fast ions [2]. The development of ELM and sawtooth control could be key to achieve stable high performance JET discharges with minimal tungsten content. Integrating such schemes into an overall control strategy will be required in future tokamaks and gaining experience on current tokamaks is essential.']\n",

However, such adoption remains conditional on identifying adequate incentives that engage humans and their connected devices in a plethora of collective activities. To this end, the mission of our research is to advance the vision of social-aware and trusted D2D connectivity, as well as to facilitate its further adoption. We begin by reviewing the various types of underlying incentives with the emphasis on sociality and trust, discuss these factors specifically for humans and for networked devices (machines), and also propose a novel framework allowing construction of much needed incentive-aware D2D applications. Our supportive system-level performance evaluations suggest that trusted and social-aware direct connectivity has the potential to decisively augment network performance.

As a benchmark case, we considered two-dimensional steady flow in a rectangular domain characterized by multi-Gaussian heterogeneity structure with an isotropic exponential correlation and lnK variance sigma(2)(Y) up to 8. Advective transport is investigated using the travel time framework where Lagrangian variables (e. g., velocity, transverse displacement, or travel time) depend on space rather than on time. We find that Eulerian and Lagrangian velocity distributions diverge for increasing lnK variance due to enhanced channeling. Transverse displacement is a nonnormal for all sigma(2)(Y) and control planes close to the injection area, but after xI(Y) = 20 was found to be nearly normal even for high sigma(2)(Y). Travel time distribution deviates from the Fickian model for large lnK variance and exhibits increasing skewness and a power law tail for large lnK variance, the slope of which decreases for increasing distance from the source; no anomalous features are found. Second moment of advective transport is analyzed with respect to the covariance of two Lagrangian velocity variables: slowness and slope which are directly related to the travel time and transverse displacement variance, which are subsequently related to the longitudinal and transverse dispersion. We provide simple estimators for the Eulerian velocity variance, travel time variance, slowness, and longitudinal dispersivity as a practical contribution of this analysis. Both two-parameter models considered (the advection-dispersion equation and the lognormal model) provide relatively poor representations of the initial part of the travel time probability density function in highly heterogeneous porous media. We identify the need for further theoretical and experimental scrutiny of early arrival times, and the need for computing higher-order moments for a more accurate characterization of the travel time probability density function. A brief discussion is presented on the challenges and extensions for which AFMCM is suggested as a suitable approach.']\n",

For this storage scenario, the host rock is the third and final barrier for radionuclide migration. Sorption reactions in the crystalline rock matrix have strong retardative effects on the transport of radionuclides. To assess the barrier properties of the host rock it is important to have sorption data representative of the undisturbed host rock conditions. Sorption data is in the majority of reported cases determined using crushed rock. Crushing has been shown to increase a rock samples sorption capacity by creating additional surfaces. There are several problems with such an extrapolation. In studies where this problem is addressed, simple models relating the specific surface area to the particle size are used to extrapolate experimental data to a value representative of the host rock conditions. In this article, we report and compare surface area data of five size fractions of crushed granite and of 100 mm long drillcores as determined by the Brunauer Emmet Teller (BET)-method using N-2-gas. Special sample holders that could hold large specimen were developed for the BET measurements. Surface area data on rock samples as large as the drillcore has not previously been published. An analysis of this data show that the extrapolated value for intact rock obtained from measurements on crushed material was larger than the determined specific surface area of the drillcores, in some cases with more than 1000%. Our results show that the use of data from crushed material and current models to extrapolate specific surface areas for host rock conditions can lead to over estimation interpretations of sorption ability.

Three normal loading conditions were adopted in the tests: simple normal stress and mixed normal stress and normal stiffness to reflect more realistic in situ conditions.

To reproduce the inflation of stent systems as in clinical practice, a pneumatic-hydraulic experimental setup is built, able to record loads and deformations. Characteristic pressure-diameter diagrams for the balloon-expandable stents and the detached balloons are experimentally obtained. Additionally, typical measures such as the burst opening pressure, the maximum dog-boning and foreshortening, and the elastic recoil are determined. The adopted constitutive models account for elastoplastic deformation of the stent, and for the nonlinear and anisotropic behavior of the balloon. The employed contact algorithm, based on a C (2)-continuous surface parametrization, efficiently simulates the interaction of the balloon and stent. The computational model is able to successfully capture the experimentally observed deformation mechanisms. Overall, the numerical results are in satisfactory agreement with experimental data.']\n",

      "['A new theoretical model for the growth of saccular cerebral aneurysms is proposed by extending the recent constitutive framework of Kroon and Holzapfel [2007a. A model for saccular cerebral aneurysm growth by collagen fibre remodelling. J. Theor. Biol. 247, 775-787]. The continuous turnover of collagen is taken to be the driving mechanism in aneurysmal growth. The collagen production rate depends on the magnitude of the cyclic deformation of fibroblasts, caused by the pulsating blood pressure during the cardiac cycle. The volume density of fibroblasts in the aneurysmal tissue is taken to be constant throughout the growth process. The growth model is assessed by considering the inflation of an axisymmetric membranous piece of aneurysmal tissue, with material characteristics representative of a cerebral aneurysm. The diastolic and systolic states of the aneurysm are computed, together with its load-free state. It turns out that the value of collagen pre-stretch, that determines growth speed and stability of the aneurysm, is of pivotal importance. The model is able to predict aneurysms with typical berry-like shapes observed clinically, and the predicted wall stresses correlate well with the experimentally obtained ultimate stresses of this type of tissue. The model predicts that aneurysms should fail when reaching a size of about 1.2-3.6 mm, which is smaller than what has been clinically observed. With some refinements, the model may, however, be used to predict future growth of diagnosed aneurysms.']\n",

      "['Wood exhibits a hierarchical architecture. Its macroscopic properties are determined by microstructural features at different scales of observation. Recent developments of experimental micro-characterisation techniques have delivered further insight into the appearance and the behaviour of wood at smaller length scales. The improved knowledge and the availability of increasingly powerful micromechanical modelling techniques and homogenisation methods have stimulated rather comprehensive research on multiscale modelling of wood. Linking microstructural properties to macroscopic characteristics is expected to improve the knowledge of the mechanical behaviour of wood and to serve as the basis for the development of innovative wood-based products and for biomimetic material design. Moreover, understanding fundamental aspects of wood machining requires multiscale approaches which can take into account the heterogeneity, anisotropy and hierarchies of wood and wood composites. In this review, recent developments in the field of hierarchical modelling of the hygroelastic behaviour of wood are discussed, and a short outline of the theoretical background is given. Much focus is placed on composite micromechanical models for the wood cell wall and on multiscale models for wood resting upon hierarchical finite element models and on the application of continuum micromechanics, respectively. These models generally lead to the specification of equivalent homogeneous continua with effective material properties. Finally, current deficiencies and limitations of hierarchical models are sketched and possible future research directions are specified.']\n",

Rectangular patches from the right ventricular free wall and the interventricular were separated, bi-axially stretched and immersed in physiological salt solution at 37 C before load displacement curves of m total 891 penetrations were recorded. To this end flat-bottomed cylindrical punches of different diameters were used, and following mechanical testing the penetration were histological analyzed using light and electron microscopes. Penetration pressure, i.e. penetration force divided by punch cross-sectional area decreased slightly from 2.27(SD 0.66) to 1.76 (SD 0.46) N mm(2) for punches of 1.32 to 2.30 mm in diameter, respectively. Deep penetration formed cleavages aligned with the local fiber orientation of the tissue, and hence, a mode-I crack developed, where the crack faces were wedged open by the advancing punch. The performed study derived novel failure data from ventricular tissue due to deep penetration and uncovered associated failure mechanisms. This provides information to derive mechanical failure models, which are essential to enrich our current understanding of failure of soft biological tissues and to guide medical device development.']\n",

Biomechanical behavior of the arterial wall and its numerical characterization. Comput. Biol.

A strain energy function for arteries accounting for wall composition and structure. J. Biomech. 37, 989-1000] propose Psi = c(I-1 - 3)(3/2). We analyse these constitutive models for two specific cases: (i) uniaxial extension of an elastinous sheet; (ii) inflation of a cylindrical elastinous membrane. For case (i) we illustrate the functional relationships between: (a) the Cauchy stress (CS) and the Green-Lagrange (GL) strain; (b) the tangent modulus (gradient of the CS-GL strain curve) and linearised strain. The predicted mechanical responses are compared with recent uniaxial extension tests on elastin [Gundiah, N., Ratcliffe, M.B., Pruitt, L.A., 2007.

The neo-Hookean model accurately predicts the mechanical response of a single elastin fibre. However, it is unable to accurately capture the mechanical response of arterial elastin, e.g. the initial toe region of arterial elastin (if it exists) or the gradual increase in modulus of arterial elastin that occurs as it is stretched. The alternative constitutive model (n = 1) yields a nonlinear mechanical response that departs from recent uniaxial test data mentioned above, for the same stretch range. For case (ii) we illustrate the pressure-circumferential stretch relationships and the gradients of the pressure-circumferential stretch curves: significant qualitative differences are observed. For the neo-Hookean model, the gradient decreases rapidly to zero, however, for n = 3 the gradient decreases more gradually to a constant value. We conclude that whilst the neo-Hookean model has limitations, it appears to capture more accurately the mechanical response of elastin.']\n",

This phenomenon proves that the isometric force production is not only dependent on current muscle length and length time derivative, but depends on the preceding contraction history. Isolated extensor digitorum longus and soleus muscles from mice (NMRI strain) were used to investigate the force produced by a muscle, and some parameters hypothetically influencing this history-dependent force modification. The muscles were pre-stimulated at a fixed length, then different stretch/shortening episodes were introduced, whereafter changes of the active force were recorded while the muscles were held isometrically to approach a steady-state force before de-stimulation. The mechanical work during active stretch and shortening was evaluated by integrating the product of force and ramp velocity over the length-varying period. The results show a negative linear correlation between the force modification and the mechanical work produced on or by the muscle, continuous between shortening and stretch. A corresponding modification of the passive force component following each stimulation was also observed. The conclusion is that the isometric force attained after stretch or shortening is well described by an asymptotic force which is determined by the mechanical work.']\n",

The anatase TiO2(001) and its (1 x 4) reconstructed surfaces were theoretically considered to be the most reactive and have been heavily pursued by synthetic chemists. However, the lack of direct experimental verification or determination of the active sites on these surfaces has caused controversy and debate. Here we report a systematic study on an anatase TiO2(001)-(1 x 4) surface by means of microscopic and spectroscopic techniques in combination with first-principles calculations. Two types of intrinsic point defects are identified, among which only the Ti3+ defect site on the reduced surface demonstrates considerable chemical activity. The perfect surface itself can be fully oxidized, but shows no obvious activity. Our findings suggest that the reactivity of the anatase TiO2(001) surface should depend on its reduction status, similar to that of rutile TiO2 surfaces.']\n",

It can, however, also be estimated from a kinetic point of view by studying the process of colloidal coagulation, or from a dynamic point of view by considering colloidal transport in nonequilibrium systems where other processes such as diffusion and the influence of gravity come into play. In particular, in a test tube where colloidal expansion takes place, the ccc can be interpreted as the electrolyte concentration below which expansion of colloids would always lead to full access to the entire volume of the test tube and above which a sharp boundary is established between a colloidal gel and pure water. On the basis of this perception and the dynamic force balance model that we developed to describe colloidal expansion in a test tube, accounting for the effects of particle diffusion and gravity in contrast to the DLVO theory, we propose an alternative way to assess the ccc of counterions. We also derive an approximate expression for the case of homointeraction at constant charge for montmorillonite. The estimated ccc values agree quite well with those observed experimentally for both Na+ and Ca2+ counterions for montmorillonite dispersions, at pH similar to 6.5. This is in contrast to the DLVO theory, which overpredicts the ccc by about 2 orders of magnitude. In addition, the detailed analyses suggest that the ccc of counterions decreases with increasing surface area and with the thickness of the particles. For montmorillonite, the ccc is nearly independent of the surface charge density of the particles for the range of typical charge densities.']\n",

This is exemplified by experiments on steel corroded from operation in a chlorate plant, which exhibits significantly higher activity for hydrogen evolution than polished steel or iron.']\n",

The  EPS of the denitrifying biomarker Comamonas denitrificans strain 110,  produced in different culture media and growth modes, were  characterized. The EPS mainly contained protein (3-37%), nucleic acids  (9-50%), and carbohydrates (3-21%). The extracellular DNA was found to  be important for initial biofilm formation since biofilm, but not  planktonic growth, was inhibited in the presence of DNase. The  polysaccharide fraction appeared to consist of at least two distinct  polymers, one branched fraction (A) made up of glucose and mannose with a  molecular weight around 100 kDa. The other fraction (B) was larger and  consisted of ribose, mannose, glucose, rhamnose, arabinose, galactose,  and N-acetylglucosamine. Fraction B polysaccharides were mainly found in  capsular EPS which was the dominant type in biofilms and agar-grown  colonies.

Biofilm and agar-grown EPS displayed similar  overall properties while planktonic EPS showed clear compositional  disparity. This study presents results on the physiology of a key WWT  organism, which may be useful in the future development of improved  biofilm techniques for WWT purposes.']\n",

Polonite previously used for on-site wastewater treatment was applied as a soil amendment to a mountain meadow. The amendment significantly increased soil pH and decreased the hydrolytic acidity, thus reducing Al toxicity risks. The effects were comparable to those of liming. No difference in yield and P uptake by meadow plants was observed. The uptake of metals was lower for amended soils, especially the uptake of Mn.

The water sorption saturation concentration did not reach a steady-state value but gradually increased in many cases upon long-term exposure. The diffusion coefficient was not significantly affected. Infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry indicated that the net mass loss from the thermosets on immersion in water was due to the leaching of non-reacted styrene, monomer, and additives. It is suggested that this, together with polymer relaxation processes (as measured on specimens under tension in water at 80<sup>o</sup>C), is the primary reason for the time-dependent increase in the water saturation concentration. Infrared spectroscopy indicated that, even at the highest temperatures, hydrolysis of the polymer ester groups was small.

The polyelectrolyte adsorption was studied by SPAR as a function of salt concentration, and it was found that the adsorption maximum was located at 1 mM NaCl for polyelectrolytes of low charge density and at 10 mM NaCl for polyelectrolytes of high charge density. Electrostatic screening led to complete elimination of the polyelectrolyte adsorption at salt concentrations of 300 mM NaCl. According to the QCM-D analysis, the cellulose films showed a pronounced swelling in water that took several hours to complete. Subsequent adsorption of polyelectrolytes onto the cellulose films led to a release of water from the cellulose, an effect that was substantial for polyelectrolytes of high charge density at low salt concentrations.

One promising approach is to make blends of PANT in polymeric resins. However, in this approach other problems related to the difficulty of achieving a homogeneous PANI dispersion arise. The present article is focused on this general problem, and we discuss how the synthesis method, choice of dopant and solvent as well as interfacial energies influence the dispersibility. For this purpose, different synthesis methods and dopants have been employed to prepare nanostructures of polyaniline. Dynamic light scattering analysis of dispersions of the synthesized particles in several solvents was employed in order to understand how the choice of solvent affects PANT aggregation. Further information on this subject was achieved by scanning electron microscopy studies of PANT powders dried from various solutions. On the basis of these results, acetone was found to be a suitable dispersion medium for PANI. The polymer matrix used to make the blends in this work is a UV-curing solvent-free resin. Therefore, there is no low molecular weight liquid in the system to facilitate the mixing process and promote formation of homogeneous dispersions. Thus, a good compatibility of the components becomes crucial. For this reason, surface tension and contact angle measurements were utilized for characterizing the surface energy of the PANI particles and the polyester acrylate (PEA) resin, and also for calculating the interfacial energy between these two components that revealed good compatibility within the PANI/PEA blend. A novel technique, based on centrifugal sedimentation analysis, was employed in order to determine the PANT particle size in PEA resin, and high dispersion stability of the PANI/PEA blends was suggested by evaluation of the sedimentation data.']\n",

The theoretical and computational description of this binding (as well as that of other transition metals) is a challenging task. In this paper the binding of the Zn ion to four cysteine residues in the structural site of horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (HLADH) is studied using a synthetic peptide mimic of this site. The study includes experimental measurements of binding constants, classical free energy calculations from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and quantum mechanical (QM) electron structure calculations. The classical MD results account for interactions at the molecular level and reproduce the absolute binding energy and the hydration free energy of the Zn ion with an accuracy of about 10%. This is insufficient to obtain correct free energy differences. QM correction terms were calculated from density functional theory (DFT) on small clusters of atoms to include electronic polarisation of the closest waters and covalent contributions to the Zn-S coordination bond. This results in reasonably good agreement with the experimentally measured binding constants and Zn ion hydration free energies in agreement with published experimental values. The study also includes the replacement of one cysteine residue to an alanine. Simulations as well as experiments showed only a small effect of this upon the binding free energy. A detailed analysis indicate that the sulfur is replaced by three water molecules, thereby changing the coordination number of Zn from four (as in the original peptide) to six (as in water).']\n",

From trajectories of a system containing 1024 lipids we obtain wave vectors down to 0.34 nm(-1), which enables us to directly resolve the Rayleigh and Brillouin lines of the spectrum. The results confirm the validity of a model based on generalized hydrodynamics, but also improves the line widths and the position of the Brillouin lines. The improved resolution shows that the Rayleigh line is narrower than in earlier studies, which corresponds to a smaller thermal diffusivity. From a detailed analysis of the power spectrum, we can, in fact, distinguish two dispersive contributions to the elastic scattering. These translate to two exponential relaxation processes in separate time domains. Further, by including a first correction to the wave-vector-dependent position of the Brillouin lines, the results agree favorably to generalized hydrodynamics even up to intermediate wave vectors, and also yields a 20% higher adiabatic sound velocity. The width of the Brillouin lines shows a linear, not quadratic, dependence to low wave vectors.']\n",

First, the solvent dependence of the equilibria between anti-syn forms, C((3'))-endo-C((2'))-endo conformations, and carbinol group rotamers has been discussed from MD calculations. We find that in both the solvents the adenosine molecule can remain either in anti or syn conformations. But, the anti-syn interconversion occurs relatively faster in water solvent than in chloroform solvent. Because of the relatively larger time scale for the interconversion, anti and syn conformational states of adenosine are studied separately in water and chloroform solvents using CPMD calculations. The dipole moments calculated from CPMD and MD calculations for adenosine in water are significantly larger than in chloroform solvent. On the basis of the CPMD calculations, the syn form of adenosine in water has a larger dipole moment than the anti form. Moreover, the molecular geometry of anti and syn forms of adenosine in these two solvents is reported. We report a remarkable solvent effect on the geometry of the anti form of the adenosine, which is attributed to differences in the intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen-bonding, stabilization. We also report the solvent effect on the frontier Kohn-Sham orbitals and energy gaps for anti-syn conformational states. Finally, we report the solvation shell structure of adenosine in both the solvents, and we find that the solvent-solute interaction is site-specific in the case of water while in chloroform solvent the interaction is globular isotropic in nature.\"]\n",

However, patients with central visual field loss seem to benefit from peripheral correction, and animal studies suggest a role for peripheral vision in the development of myopia. This study was conducted to bridge this gap by systematically studying the sensitivity to optical defocus in a wide range of peripheral visual tasks. METHODS. The spatial frequency threshold for detection and resolution in high and low contrast with stationary and drifting gratings were measured off-axis (20 nasal visual field) in five subjects with a peripheral optical correction that was varied systematically +/- 4 D. RESULTS. All visual tasks, except high-contrast resolution, were sensitive to optical defocus, particularly low-contrast resolution with an increase of up to 0.227 logMAR/D. The two myopic subjects exhibited a very low sensitivity to defocus by negative lenses for low-contrast tasks, whereas all subjects were equally affected by myopic defocus. Contrary to expectations, drifting gratings made little difference overall. CONCLUSIONS. Optical defocus as low as 1 D has a large impact on most peripheral visual tasks, with high-contrast resolution being the exception. Since the everyday visual scenery consists of objects at different contrast levels, it is understandable that persons with central visual field loss are helped by correction of peripheral refractive errors. The asymmetry in sensitivity to peripheral optical defocus in low-contrast tasks that was experienced by the myopic subjects in this study merits further investigation.']\n",

Results. Peripheral refraction components were similar in both age groups.

The investigation is performed on the TALL test facility at KTH. The heat exchangers have counter-current flow arrangement, and are made from a pair of 1-m-long concentric ducts, with the LBE flowing in the inner tube of 10mm I.D. and the secondary coolant flowing in the annulus. The inlet temperature of LBE into the heat exchangers is from 200 degrees C to 450 degrees C with temperature drops from 0 degrees C to 100 degrees C within the LBE flow range of Re = 10(4)-10(5). Analysis of the experimental results obtained provides a basic understanding and quantification of the regimes of lead-bismuth flow and heat transfer through a straight tube and a U-shaped tube. The unique data base also serves as benchmark and improvement for system thermal-hydraulic codes (e.g. RELAP, TRAC/AAA) whose development and testing were dominantly driven by applications in water-cooled systems. Lessons and insights learnt from the study and recommendations for the heat exchanger selection are discussed.']\n",

Subsequently, the molten corium can be relocated in the containment cavity forming a melt pool. The melt pool can be flooded with water at the top for quenching it. However, the question that arises is to what extent the water can ingress in the corium melt pool to cool and quench it. To reveal that, a numerical study has been carried out using the computer code MELCOOL The code considers the heat transfer behaviour in axial and radial directions from the molten pool to the overlaying water, crust generation and growth, thermal stresses built-in the crust, disintegration of crust into debris, natural convection heat transfer in debris and water ingression into the debris bed. To validate the computer code, experiments were conducted in a facility named as core melt coolability (COMECO). The facility consists of a test section (200 mm x 200 mm square cross-section) and with a height of 300 mm. About 14 L of melt comprising of 30% CaO + 70% B2O3 (by wt.) was poured into the test section. The melt was heated by four heaters from outside the test section to simulate the decay heat of corium. The melt was water flooded from the top, and the depth of water pool was kept constant at around 700 mm throughout the experiment. The transient temperature behaviour in the melt pool at different axial and radial locations was measured with 24 K-type thermocouples and the steam flow rate was measured using a vortex flow meter. The melt temperature measurements indicated that water could ingress only up to a certain depth into the melt pool. The MELCOOL predictions were compared with the test data for the temperature distribution inside the molten pool.

Compared with a rectangular grid an equilateral triangular grid allows a larger unit cell without any onset of grating lobes. Since single polarized tapered-slots in triangular grids support guided modes, which cause scan blindness, the increase in unit cell size is smaller than the optimal 15%. The design presented in the paper is capable of scan angles out to 60° from broadside in the E and H planes. To improve the match over the radar band a local minimum in the active reflection coefficient is positioned at the most critical scan direction, resulting in a reflection coefficient that is less than -12 dB in the X-band. To reduce the radar cross section for the cross-polarization an absorbing layer is positioned above the ground plane, which affects some of the guided modes that lead to scan blindnesses. An experimental antenna with 16Á—16 elements was built, and it was found that the H-plane performance for large scan angles for the finite antenna deviates more than expected from the infinite array approximation.

A boundary layer  of Falkner-“Skan-“Cooke type with favourable pressure gradient is  considered to model the flow slightly downstream of a swept-wing leading  edge. In this region, stationary and travelling crossflow instability  dominates over other instability types. Three scenarios are  investigated: the presence of low-amplitude chordwise localized,  spanwise periodic roughness elements on the plate, the impingement of a  weak vortical free-stream mode on the boundary layer and the combination  of both disturbance sources. Three receptivity mechanisms are  identified: steady receptivity to roughness, unsteady receptivity to  free-stream vorticity and unsteady receptivity to vortical modes  scattered at the roughness. Both roughness and vortical modes provide  efficient direct receptivity mechanisms for stationary and travelling  crossflow instabilities. We find that stationary crossflow modes  dominate for free-stream turbulence below a level of about 0.5%, whereas  higher turbulence levels will promote the unsteady receptivity  mechanism. Under the assumption of small amplitudes of the roughness and  the free-stream disturbance, the unsteady receptivity process due to  scattering of free-stream vorticity at the roughness has been found to  give small initial disturbance amplitudes in comparison to the direct  mechanism for free-stream modes. However, in many environments  free-stream vorticity and roughness may excite interacting unstable  stationary and travelling crossflow waves.

The methods are applied to the two-dimensional spatially developing Blasius boundary-layer. A critical step in the process of systematically investigating stability properties and designing feedback controllers is solving very large eigenvalue problems by storing only velocity fields at different times instead of large matrices. For stability analysis, where the entire dynamics of perturbations in space and time is of interest, iterative and adjoint-based optimization techniques are employed to compute the global eigenmodes and the optimal initial conditions. The latter are the initial conditions yielding the largest possible energy growth over a finite time interval. The leading global eigenmodes take the shape of Tollmien-Schlichting wavepackets located far downstream in streamwise direction, whereas the leading optimal disturbances are tilted structures located far upstream in the boundary layer. For control design on the other hand, the input-output behavior of the system is of interest and the snapshot-method is employed to compute balanced modes that correctly capture this behavior. The inputs are external disturbances and wall actuation and the outputs are sensors that extract wall shear stress. A low-dimensional model that capture the input-output behavior is constructed by projection onto balanced modes. The reduced-order model is then used to design a feedback control strategy such that the growth of disturbances are damped as they propagate downstream.']\n",

Moreover three different vortex blade heights h, with the spacing d and the distance to the neighbouring vortex pair D for the array con guration, were studied keeping the same d / h and D / h ratios. It is shown that the vortex core paths scale with h in the streamwise direction and with D and h in the spanwise and wall-normal directions, respectively. A new peculiar \"hooklike\" vortex core motion, seen in the cross-ow plane, has been identi ed in the far region, starting around 200h and 50h for the pair and the array con guration, respectively. This behaviour is explained in the paper. Furthermore the experimental data indicate that the vortex paths asymptote to a prescribed location in the cross-ow plane, which rst was stated as a hypothesis and later veri ed. This observation goes against previously reported numerical results based on inviscid theory. An account for the important viscous e ects is taken in a pseudo-viscous vortex model which is able to capture the streamwise core evolution throughout the measurement region down to 450h. Finally, the e ect of yawing is reported, and it is shown that spanwiseaveraged quantities such as the shape factor and the circulation are hardly perceptible. However, the evolution of the vortex cores are di erent both between the pair and the array con guration and in the natural setting versus the case with yaw. From a general point of view the present paper reports on fundamental results concerning the vortex evolution in a fully developed turbulent boundary layer.']\n",

A fully three-dimensional unstable steady-state solution and its associated global eigenmodes are computed by direct numerical simulations and iterative eigenvalue routines. The steady flow, obtained by means of selective frequency damping, consists mainly of a (steady) counter-rotating vortex pair (CVP) in the far field and horseshoe-shaped vortices close to the wall. High-frequency unstable global eigenmodes associated with shear-layer instabilities on the CVP and low-frequency modes associated with shedding vortices in the wake of the jet are identified. Furthermore, different spanwise symmetries of the global modes are discussed. This work constitutes the first simulation-based global stability analysis of a fully three-dimensional base flow.']\n",

The body forces are determined by computing local angles of attack and  using tabulated aerofoil coefficients. The advantage of using the  actuator-line technique is that it is not needed to resolve blade  boundary layers and instead the computational resources are devoted to  simulating the dynamics of the flow structures. In the present study,  approximately 5 million mesh points are used to resolve the wake  structure in a 120-degree domain behind the turbine.

The constant Launder parameter in the contraction, K = 6.25 x10 (-aEuro parts per thousand 6), was twice the value required for a turbulent boundary layer to relaminarize. In addition to the mixing analysis inside the contraction, layer mixing is also investigated downstream, where the flow continues inside a constant cross-section channel. In order to generate the passive scalar, the airflow above the plate was heated and the temperature stratification in the wake was traced by measuring the temperature field using constant current anemometry. Using different plate lengths, we found that the degree of mixing, obtained at a given position in the straight channel, is a function of the distance from the plate trailing edge to the contraction outlet. For a plate which does not protrude into the straight channel, we demonstrate the existence of an optimal trailing edge-contraction outlet distance that results in the lowest possible degree of mixing at a given downstream position in the straight channel. This finding is also supported by a semi-empirical relationship based on our developed self-similar solution for mixing layers in planar contractions.']\n",

Recently, Tulloch and Smith suggested that a surface quasigeostrophic (SQG) turbulence model can explain the observed spectra. Here, it is first argued that the mesoscale spectra are not likely to be explained by any quasigeostrophic model because the Rossby number corresponding to the mesoscale dynamics is on the order of unity or larger. Then it is argued that the SQG model in particular cannot explain the observations because its mesoscale spectrum displays a k(-5/3) dependence only in a very thin layer just below the tropopause. The thickness of this layer can be estimated to be of the order of 10 m, whereas aircraft measurements are typically performed several hundred meters away from the tropopause.']\n",

      "['Evolution of flat-plate wakes in sink flow has been studied both analytically and experimentally. For such wakes, a similarity solution is derived which considers simultaneous presence of both laminar and turbulent stresses inside the wake. This solution utilizes an additional Reynolds-stress term which represents the fluctuations similar to those in wall-bounded flows, accounting for the fluctuations originating from the plate boundary layer. In this solution, it is shown that the total stress, the sum of laminar and Reynolds shear stresses, becomes self-similar. To investigate the accuracy of the analytical results, the wake of a flat plate located at the centreline of a planar contraction is studied using hot-wire anemometry. Wakes of both tapered and blunt edges are considered. The length of the plates and the flow acceleration number K = 6.25 x 10(-6) are chosen such that the boundary-layer profiles at the plate edge approach the self-similar laminar solution of Pohlhausen (Z. Angew. Math. Mech., vol. 1, 1921, p. 252). A short plate in which the boundary layer at the edge does not fully relaminarize is also considered. The development of the turbulent diffusivity used in the analysis is determined empirically for each experimental case. We have shown that the obtained similarity solutions, accounting also for the initial conditions in each case, generally agree well with the experimental results even in the near field. The results also show that the mean velocity of the transitional wake behind a tapered edge becomes self-similar almost immediately downstream of the edge.']\n",

This paper studies the influence of a mean flow field and unstable separated flow on the reactive properties of the expansion, formulated as an end correction. Theoretical and experimental results show that the expansion end correction is significantly affected by the flow and hydrodynamic waves excited at the edge of the expansion. The effects are different in three regions where the Strouhal number is small, of order 1, and large. The influence is most significant at Strouhal numbers of the order 1, with specific limiting values for large and small Strouhal numbers, respectively. In the analytic model, an important feature is the shear layer at the edge modeled as a vortex sheet with the unsteady Kutta condition applied at the edge. The influence of Mach number, Helmholtz number, and area expansion ratio is studied, and a quasistationary, small Strouhal number, approximation yields an expression for the end correction. Further, the influence of edge condition is explored, emphasizing the importance of interaction between sound and unsteady vorticity shedding at the edge of the area expansion.']\n",

      "[\"It is well known among geodesists that the gravitational effect of the topography must be removed (direct topographic effect) prior to geoid computation, for example, by Stokes' formula, and restored afterward (indirect topographic effect). The direct effect is usually decomposed into the effects of the Bouguer shell (-V-B) and the terrain. While the computation of V-B is a simple matter, the detailed consideration of the terrain effect is more difficult. This study emphasizes, that, in principle, the geoid height can be determined by the remove restore technique in considering only V-B and the effect of an arbitrarily small area of the terrain along the radius vector at the computation point, and that the determination of VB requires only the density distribution be known along this radius. The method is justified by the approximation theorems of Runge-Krarup and Keldysh-Lavrentieff. The answer to the headline question is therefore no. A closely related question is how to find a candidate method for the analytical continuation of the external potential. The paper studies whether a Taylor series can take on this role. It is concluded that this series will converge, if the direct effects of the Bouguer potential and the mass of the terrain in a near-zone around the computation point (P) are applied prior to downward continuation. The radius of the near-zone is shown not to exceed that of the height of any mountain around P, which, in the worst case (with P located near the top of Mt Everest) yields a radius of convergence within 9 km. In most cases the radius is much smaller. Hence, only a very local part of the terrain potential must be removed to allow the determination of the geoid height by Taylor expansion. Importantly, if the height of P is at least twice that of any point of the near-zone topography (e.g. for airborne and satellite gravity), the Taylor series always converges without any reduction for terrain.\"]\n",

Based on T and the gravity disturbance data, we directly downward continue T to the geoid, and we present the final solution for the geoid height, including topographic corrections. It can be proved that the Taylor expansion of T converges if the flight level is at least twice the height of the topography, and the terrain potential will not contribute to the topographic correction.

The problem can be formulated mathematically as that of solving a non-linear Fredholm integral equation of the first kind, and we present an iterative procedure for its solution. Moreover, we prove the uniqueness of the solution. Second, the integral equation is modified to a more suitable form, and an iterative solution is presented also for this. Also, a second-order approximate formula is derived, which determines the Moho depth to first/linear order by an earth gravitational model (EGM), and the remaining short-wavelength/non-linear part, of the order of 2 km, can be determined by iteration. A direct, second-order formula, in principle accurate to the order of 25 m, combines the first-order solution from an EGM with a second-order term, which may include terrestrial Bouguer gravity anomalies around the computation point.']\n",

Published GPS data show an uplift of about 13 +/- A 5 mm/a near the ice margin. A gravity decrease of -2 +/- A 1 mu Gal/a relative to the Hofn base station, was observed for the same sites. Control measurements at the Hofn station showed a gravity decrease of -2 +/- A 0.5 A mu Gal/a relative to the station RVIK 5473 at Reykjavik (about 250 km from Hofn). This is compatible, as a Bouguer effect, with a 10 +/- A 3 mm/a uplift rate of the IGS point at Hofn and an uplift rate of similar to 20 mm/a near the ice margin. Although the derived gravity change rates at individual sites have large uncertainties, the ensemble of the rates varies systematically and significantly with distance from the ice. The relationship between gravity and elevation changes and the shrinking ice mass is modelled as response to the loading history. The GPS data can be explained by 1-D modelling (i.e., an earth model with a 15-km thick elastic lithosphere and a 7 center dot 10(17) Pa center dot s asthenosphere viscosity), but not the gravity data. Based on 2-D modelling, the gravity data favour a low-viscosity plume in the form of a cylinder of 80 km radius and 10(17) to 10(18) Pa center dot s viscosity below a 6 km-thick elastic lid, embedded in a layered PREM-type earth, although the elevation data are less well explained by this model. Strain-porosity-hydrology effects are likely to enhance the magnitude of the gravity changes, but need verification by drilling. More accurate data may resolve the discrepancies or suggest improved models.']\n",

First, the solution is derived for a constant topographic density, in which case the bias can be expressed by a very simple formula related with the topographic height above the computation point. Second, for an arbitrary density distribution the bias becomes an integral along the vertical from the computation point to the Earth's surface. No topographic masses, except those along the vertical through the computation point, affect the bias.

Malignancy is however, rare, the yearly incidence being 0.5-2 per million inhabitants, but associated with a very aggressive behaviour. Adrenocortical tumours are often associated with altered hormone production with a variety of clinical symptoms. The aggressiveness of carcinomas together with the high frequency of adenomas calls for a deeper understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms and an improvement of the diagnostic possibilities. Methods: Microarray gene expression analysis was performed in tumours of adrenocortex with emphasis on malignancy as well as hormonal activity. The sample set consisted of 17 adenomas, 11 carcinomas and 4 histological normal adrenocortexes. RNA from these was hybridised according to a reference design on microarrays harbouring 29 760 human cDNA clones. Confirmation was performed with quantitative real time-PCR and western blot analysis. Results: Unsupervised clustering to reveal relationships between samples based on the entire gene expression profile resulted in two subclusters; carcinomas and non-cancer specimens. A large number of genes were accordingly found to be differentially expressed comparing carcinomas to adenomas. Among these were IGF2, FGFR1 and FGFR4 in growth factor signalling the most predominant and also the USP4, UBE2C and UFD1L in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Moreover, two subgroups of carcinomas were identified with different survival outcome, suggesting that survival prediction can be made on the basis of gene expression profiles. Regarding adenomas with aldosterone overproduction, OSBP and VEGFB were among the most up-regulated genes compared with the other samples. Conclusions: Adrenocortical carcinomas are associated with a distinct molecular signature apparent in their gene expression profiles. Differentially expressed genes were identified associated with malignancy, survival as well as hormonal activity providing a resource of candidate genes for an exploration of possible drug targets and diagnostic and prognostic markers.']\n",

In this study, we report on an anatomically comprehensive analysis of 4842 protein profiles in 48 human tissues and 45 human cell lines. A detailed analysis of over 2 million manually annotated, high-resolution, immunohistochemistry- based images showed a high fraction (&gt;65%) of expressed proteins in most cells and tissues, with very few proteins (&lt;2%) detected in any single cell type. Similarly, confocal microscopy in three human cell lines detected expression of more than 70% of the analyzed proteins. Despite this ubiquitous expression, hierarchical clustering analysis, based on global protein expression patterns, shows that the analyzed cells can be still subdivided into groups according to the current concepts of histology and cellular differentiation. This study suggests that tissue specificity is achieved by precise regulation of protein levels in space and time, and that different tissues in the body acquire their unique characteristics by controlling not which proteins are expressed but how much of each is produced.

Strength  and stress transfer in paper sheets are controlled by fibre-fibre  bonds. In paper-reinforced plastics, where the sheet is impregnated with  a polymer resin, other stress-transfer mechanisms may be more  important. The influence of fibre-fibre bonds on the strength of  paper-reinforced plastics was therefore investigated. Paper sheets with  different degrees of fibre-fibre bonding were manufactured and used as  reinforcement in a polymeric matrix. Image analysis tools were used to  verify that the difference in the degree of fibre-fibre bonding had been  preserved in the composite materials. Strength and stiffness of the  composites were experimentally determined and showed no correlation to  the degree of fibre-fibre bonding, in contrast to the behaviour of  unimpregnated paper sheets. The degree of fibre-fibre bonding is  therefore believed to have little importance in this type of material,  where stress is mainly transferred through the fibre-matrix interface.']\n",

The presence of a nanofiber network (70 wt% cellulose nanofibers) reduced the moisture uptake to half the value of the pure plasticized starch film. The swelling yielded a moisture concentration-dependent diffusivity. Quite surprisingly, the moisture diffusivity decreased rapidly with increasing nanofiber content and the diffusivity of the neat cellulose network was, in relative terms, very low. It was possible to describe the strong decrease in zero-concentration diffusivity with increasing cellulose nanofiber/matrix ratio, simply by assuming only geometrical blocking using the model due to Aris. The adjusted model parameters suggested a \"simplified\" composite structure with dense nanofiber layers oriented in the plane of the film. Still, also constraining effects on swelling from the high modulus/hydrogen bonding cellulose network and reduced amylopectin molecular mobility due to strong starch-cellulose molecular interactions were suggested to contribute to the reductions in moisture diffusivity.']\n",

The main objective of this study was to correlate the molecular properties of black liquor xylan with its ability to increase tensile strength at a given sheet density. Black liquors were obtained from kraft cooks performed at different cooking temperatures and cooking times, which resulted in dissolved xylan with different degrees of substitution of uronic acids, different molecular weights, and connected to different amounts of lignin. These black liquors were added to the later part of subsequent kraft cooks. The results show that the degree of substitution of the black liquor xylan is of great importance when using it as an additive to the kraft cook in order to enhance pulp strength. Both, improved and deteriorated tensile strengths at given sheet densities were seen as a result of the black liquor exchange, depending on the charge of the added xylan. This illustrates that exchanging black liquor is an attractive tool in order to improve the physical properties of the produced paper if it is done wisely, but may cause impairments if the exchange is conducted in an incorrect manner. Furthermore, novel analytical tools made it possible to detect much higher uronic acid contents in xylan than previously reported.']\n",

The RBP RBM3 was recently suggested to be a proto-oncogene in colorectal cancer; however, such a role has not been corroborated by previous studies in the colon or other tumor types, and the prognostic implications of tumor-specific RBM3 expression remain unclear. Mono-specific antibodies against RBM3 were generated. Antibody specificity was confirmed using siRNA gene silencing, western blotting and immunohistochemistry on a panel of breast cancer cell lines. Using tissue microarrays and IHC, RBM3 protein expression was examined in 48 normal tissues and in 20 common cancers. Additional analysis in two independent breast cancer cohorts (n = 1016) with long-term follow-up was also carried out. RBM3 was upregulated in cancer compared to normal tissues. The nuclear expression of RBM3 in breast cancer was associated with low grade (P&lt;0.001), small tumors (P&lt;0.001), estrogen receptor (ER) positivity (P&lt;0.001) and Ki-67 negativity (P&lt;0.001) in both the breast cancer cohorts. An increased nuclear expression of RBM3 was associated with a prolonged overall and recurrence-free survival.

Methods: RBM3 mRNA expression was analysed in tumors from a cohort of 267 EOC cases (Cohort I) and RBM3 protein expression was analysed using immunohistochemistry (IHC) in an independent cohort of 154 prospectively collected EOC cases (Cohort II). Kaplan Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards modelling were applied to assess the relationship between RBM3 and recurrence free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS).

In the present study, the prognostic value of HMG-CoAR expression was examined in tumours from a cohort of patients with primary epithelial ovarian cancer. Methods: HMG-CoAR expression was assessed using immunohistochemistry (IHC) on tissue microarrays (TMA) consisting of 76 ovarian cancer cases, analysed using automated algorithms to develop a quantitative scoring model. Kaplan Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards modelling were used to estimate the risk of recurrence free survival (RFS). Results: Seventy-two tumours were suitable for analysis. Cytoplasmic HMG-CoAR expression was present in 65% (n = 46) of tumours. No relationship was seen between HMG-CoAR and age, histological subtype, grade, disease stage, estrogen receptor or Ki-67 status.

Methods: HMG-CoAR protein and RNA expression was analyzed in a cell line model of tamoxifen resistance using western blotting and PCR. HMG-CoAR mRNA expression was examined in 155 tamoxifen-treated breast tumors obtained from a previously published gene expression study (Cohort I). HMG-CoAR protein expression was examined in 422 stage II premenopausal breast cancer patients, who had previously participated in a randomized control trial comparing 2 years of tamoxifen with no systemic adjuvant treatment (Cohort II). Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards modeling were used to estimate the risk of recurrence-free survival (RFS) and the effect of HMG-CoAR expression on tamoxifen response. Results: HMG-CoAR protein and RNA expression were decreased in tamoxifen-resistant MCF7-LCC9 cells compared with their tamoxifen-sensitive parental cell line. HMG-CoAR mRNA expression was decreased in tumors that recurred following tamoxifen treatment (P &lt; 0.001) and was an independent predictor of RFS in Cohort I (hazard ratio = 0.63, P = 0.009). In Cohort II, adjuvant tamoxifen increased RFS in HMG-CoAR-positive tumors (P = 0.008). Multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that HMG-CoAR was an independent predictor of improved RFS in Cohort II (hazard ratio = 0.67, P = 0.010), and subset analysis revealed that this was maintained in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive patients (hazard ratio = 0.65, P = 0.029). Multivariate interaction analysis demonstrated a difference in tamoxifen efficacy relative to HMG-CoAR expression (P = 0.05). Analysis of tamoxifen response revealed that patients with ER-positive/HMG-CoAR tumors had a significant response to tamoxifen (P = 0.010) as well as patients with ER-positive or HMG-CoAR-positive tumors (P = 0.035). Stratification according to ER and HMG-CoAR status demonstrated that ER-positive/HMG-CoAR-positive tumors had an improved RFS compared with ER-positive/HMG-CoAR-negative tumors in the treatment arm (P = 0.033); this effect was lost in the control arm (P = 0.138), however, suggesting that HMG-CoAR predicts tamoxifen response.

Methods: Until Dec 31(st) 2008, 264 incident cases of primary invasive melanoma had been registered in the Malmo Diet and Cancer Study. Histopathological and clinical information was obtained for available cases and tissue microarrays (TMAs) constructed from 226 (85.6%) suitable paraffin-embedded tumours and 31 metastases. RBM3 expression was analysed by immunohistochemistry on the TMAs and a subset of full-face sections. Chi-square and Mann-Whitney U tests were used for comparison of RBM3 expression and relevant clinicopathological characteristics. Kaplan Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards modelling were used to assess the relationship between RBM3 and recurrence free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: RBM3 could be assessed in 215/226 (95.1%) of primary tumours and all metastases.

Strong nuclear RBM3 expression in the primary tumour was significantly associated with favourable clinicopathological parameters; i. e. non-ulcerated tumours, lower depth of invasion, lower Clark level, less advanced clinical stage, low mitotic activity and non-nodular histological type, and a prolonged RFS (RR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.27-0.91) and OS (RR = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.20-0.64).

      "[\"Ever since the innovation systems (IS) concept was coined in the late 1980s, it has been accepted as a mechanism of economic and technological development in policy circles. This recognition follows a change in our understanding of the characteristics of the innovation process as a non-linear process and having a systemic character. This changed understanding is also reflected in the movement in policy focus from <em>science</em> and <em>technology</em> (S&amp;T) policy towards <em>innovation</em> policy. In recent years, the IS approach has been downscaled from the national level (NIS) to the regional level (RIS), a system's level that has gained the interest of policy makers. There are many rationales for this regionalization of innovation policy. However, as this paper points out, there are several challenges to implement an IS policy on the regional level. Based on a case study of a Swedish regional policy programme, this paper highlights (some of) the challenges related to defining the regional system's <em>domain</em>, implementing functional regions and securing sufficient regional knowledge infrastructure. This paper argues that when the IS approach is put into policy practice and downscaled to the regional level, it stands the risk of losing its strength as a tool for coping with the structural problems connected to innovation and globalization. Based on the identified challenges, the paper is concluded with a number of more general policy implications for IS-based policies with regional intentions.\"]\n",

We observe an implementation gap between the high-level policy ambitions relating to environmental governance of the waste sector, as expressed in national policy frameworks, and the local-level decision-making procedures and outcomes. Several discrepancies are identified: between national waste policy and the local decision premises, between local waste planning and project decision making, between knowledge gathering and project decision making, and between the legal mechanism in the development consent process and the national environmental quality objectives framework. Our study indicates that the governance frameworks at different levels are quite different, and at least partly incompatible, which causes important coordination problems across levels. Sectoral developments towards an industrial marketisation of waste have rendered frameworks such as local waste plans obsolete.

Water subcooling and pool depth are found to significantly influence the debris fragments' morphology and agglomeration.

This porosity is significantly higher than the similar to 40% porosity broadly used in contemporary analysis of corium debris coolability in light water reactor severe accidents. The impact of debris formation on corium coolability is further complicated by debris fragments' sharp edges, roughened surfaces, and cavities that are partially or fully encapsulated within the debris fragments. These observations are made consistently in both the DEFOR-S experiments and other tests with prototypic and simulant corium melts. Synthesis of the debris fragments from the DEFOR-S tests conducted under different melt and coolant conditions reveal trends in particle size, particle sphericity, surface roughness, sharp edges, and internal porosity as functions of water subcooling and melt composition.

The objective of this paper is to propose a correlation that can predict the total effectof pressure drop (caused by bed resistance and grate-bed resistance), through a grate of a certain surface porosity (open area/total area) covered by the porous bed.

The predicted values of pressure drop showed a good agreement within the experimental results with ±7.10% of uncertainty.

This raises the issue of extrapolating results obtained from laboratory experiments to the field scale. As sorption is generally related to the surface area of the geological material, it is then important to consider the dependency of the specific surface area on the particle size. In this work, BET surface area determinations of samples of different particle sizes are conducted on two minerals commonly found in granite: labradorite and magnetite. The results show a linearre lationship between BET surface area and the inverse of the particle size, up to a certain particle size. Furthermore, results also show that the specific surface area for intact, larger pieces is much smaller than the one predicted by a linear extrapolation of results on crushed material. Therefore, extrapolation of BET area for fine particles to the field situation will lead to an overestimation of the surface area and thereby also the radionuclide sorption, if sorption coefficients are extrapolated as well. Also of importance is that these results show that sorption experiments on crushed material may dominantly reflect properties of new surface, created during the mechanically treatment of the samples.']\n",

To obtain and verify the friction laws predicting the hydrodynamics of the debris beds, the drag characteristics of air/water single- and two-phase flow in a particulate bed packed with multi-sized spheres or irregular sand particles were investigated on the POMECO-FL test facility. The same types of particles were then loaded in the test section of the POMECO-HT facility to obtain the dryout heat fluxes of the particulate beds heated volumetrically. The effective (mean) particle diameter is 2.25 mm for the multi-sized spheres and 1.75 mm for the sand particles, determined from the Ergun equation and the measured pressure drop of single-phase flow through the packed bed. Given the effective particle diameter, both the pressure drop and the dryout heat flux of two-phase flow through the bed can be predicted by the Reed model. The experiment also shows that the bottom injection of coolant improves the dryout heat flux significantly and the first dryout position is moving upward with increasing bottom injection flowrate. Compared with top-flooding case, the dryout heat flux of the bed can be doubled if the superficial velocity of coolant injection is 0.21-“0.27 mm/s. The experimental data provides insights for interpretation of debris bed coolability (how to deal with the multi-sized irregular particles), as well as high-quality data for validation of the coolability analysis models and codes.']\n",

The experimental results provide new data to validate/develop hydrodynamic models for coolability analysis of debris beds formed in fuel-coolant interactions during a postulated severe accident. The POMECO-FL test facility is employed to perform the experiment, with the spheres packed in a test section of 90 mm diameter and 635 mm height. The pressure drops are measured for air/water two-phase flow through the packed bed, and flow patterns are obtained by means of visual observations. Meanwhile, local void fraction in the center of the bed is measured by a microconductive probe.The experimental results show that the frictional pressure drop of single-phase flow through the bed can be predicted by the Ergun equation, if the area mean diameter of the particles is chosen in the calculation. Given the so-determined effective particle diameter, the estimation of the Reed model for two-phase flow pressure gradient in the bed has a good agreement with the experimental data. The characteristics of the local void fraction can be used to predict flow pattern and mean void fraction. It is observed that slug flow prevails when the mean void fraction is &lt;0.5, whereas annular flow dominates after the mean void fraction is &gt;0.7. If the effective particle diameter is further used as an influential parameter in flow pattern identification, the observed flow regimes of two-phase flow in porous media are well predicted by the existing flow pattern map.']\n",

We compare our scheme with conventional repetition in which the relay retransmits the entire decoded message, with parallel coding, and additionally with dynamic decode-and-forward (DDF). We provide a finite-SNR analysis for all the collaborative schemes. The analysis reveals that the proposed partial repetition method can provide a gain of several dB over conventional repetition.

Upper bounds on the distortion exponents achieved with partial CSIT under a long-term power constraint are developed.

The resolution of the feedback link should grow with the bandwidth ratio to make the distortion exponent scale as fast as that in the perfect-CSIT case.

Predictions are obtained by implementation of the micromechanics model in a finite element (FE) model developed for the single cube apparatus shear specimen.

The tensile properties scale very well with the relative density of the foam, but the compression and shear properties do not. It is believed to be due to cell edge and cell wall buckling being the dominated deformation mechanism in compression and shear for lower densities that does not occur for higher densities. Fatigue testing is then performed in tension, compression and shear. It is seen that for all load cases and densities, the fatigue life can be plotted using Basquin-™s law. The results also show that the different failure mechanisms found in the static tests are the same in fatigue. This means that the fatigue life for different load types exhibit different failure mechanisms. This shows not only as a clear difference in the stress levels for fatigue failure, but also on the slope in the fatigue life relation.']\n",

Compositions of Co, Fe, and Ni in fabricated powders were also determined by AAS and results are in very good agreement with the targeted compositions. Samples hydrolyzed using NH3 showed no significant changes in the particle size and morphology. NH3 hydrolyzed samples were much smaller than their NaOH hydrolyzed counterparts, which was attributed to the strength and concentration of the hydrolyzing agents, NH3 being about 6 times more concentrated than NaOH. This in turn influenced the nucleation rate thus the size of each nucleus formed. Strong temperature and Ni concentration dependence of magnetic parameters was observed.

The history of input and output of the aquifer were reconstructed in a  transient calibration from 1993 to 2005. Predictive simulation of the  aquifer was carried out under transient conditions to predict the future  demand of groundwater supply for the next 15 years. A baseline scenario  was worked out to obtain the piezometric surface and salinity  distribution for the \"business as usual\" conditions of the aquifer. The  \"business as usual\" scenario was predicted and simulated for the period  2006 until 2020. The effectiveness of seven management options was  proposed and assessed for comparison with the \"business as usual\"  conditions. The established simulation model was used to predict the  distribution of the piezometric surface, salinity distribution, and mass  balance under the proposed scenarios for the prediction period  2006-2020. The scenarios were: (1) relocate Garziz and MAF farms far  from the freshwater zone, (2) suspend the abstraction of grass  production for 4 months a year, (3) changes in agricultural and  irrigation system patterns, (4) establish a desalination plant, (5)  combined scenario (1 + 4), (6) combined scenario (1 + 3), and (7)  combining all scenarios (1 + 2 + 3 + 4).

These soils originated from a Swedish database containing 2200 measured soil layers representing 260 soil profiles. A simulation experiment was conducted where daily variations in water and chloride were simulated for a 20-year period in central Sweden, using the different soil profiles sampled from the database. Two approaches to calculate effective parameters were tested, in order to obtain generic soil descriptions and examine their ability to represent the average of the variation in chloride and water characteristics obtained for the respective soil type. In general, the use of these effective parameters was successful but overestimations of the water and chloride outflow occurred in the clay, which presented high spatial variability, and of the chloride concentration in the sand, which presented high temporal variability. Overall, the generic soil descriptions were useful in producing reasonable behaviour regarding water and chloride dynamics and could be recommended for general assessments of the environmental impact of non-reactive solutes from ;areas where simplified soil classifications are available.']\n",

An improved method reflecting soil water retention in terms of cumulative evapotranspiration, so that its value is less dependent on soil storage and more dependent on antecedent climate, is used.

Due to increasing activities in agriculture and industrial sectors, water resources management in the basin is one of the biggest matters for the future. During the past decade, it has been observed a basinwide shift to larger monocultural, intensively operated farm units. Therefore, there is land use conversion from native lands to agriculture. The threat of nutrients pollution, nitrogen and phosphorus, has become a preoccupation since many lands and rivers undergo a eutrophication process. The discharge of nutrients from Buyuk Menderes basin to the Aegean Sea through Buyuk Menderes river also needs to be reduced in order to bring the eutrophication problems under lasting control. In this paper, the PolFlow model embedded in PCraster is applied to the catchment for quantifying water and substances fluxes for the five-year period, 1999-2004. The implementation of the model in the catchment allows describing the water balance and thus nutrient transport on the landscape surface but also through the soil and aquifer's layers. Modeling process is complicated by the transfer of nutrients from diffuse and point-source emissions, managed by retention and periodic release from storages within the catchment. Modeling diffuse and point-source nutrient emissions contribution to river loads can be improved by better knowledge about spatial and temporal distribution of this retention and release in the basin.\"]\n",

This process can be used in water treatment to remove U(VI). To develop a consistent geochemical model for U(VI) adsorption to ferrihydrite, batch experiments were performed and previous data sets reviewed to optimize a set of surface complexation constants using the 3-plane CD-MUSIC model. To consider the effect of dissolved organic matter (DOM) on U(VI) speciation, new parameters for the Stockholm Humic Model (SHM) were optimized using previously published data. The model, which was constrained from available X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy evidence, fitted the data well when the surface sites were divided into low- and high-affinity binding sites. Application of the model concept to other published data sets revealed differences in the reactivity of different ferrihydrites towards U(VI). Use of the optimized SHM parameters for U(VI)-DOM complexation showed that this process is important for U(VI) speciation at low pH. However in neutral to alkaline waters with substantial carbonate present, Ca-U-CO3 complexes predominate. The calibrated geochemical model was used to simulate U(VI) adsorption to ferrihydrite for a hypothetical groundwater in the presence of several competitive ions. The results showed that U(VI) adsorption was strong between pH 5 and 8. Also near the calcite saturation limit, where U(VI) adsorption was weakest according to the model, the adsorption percentage was predicted to be &gt;80%. Hence U(VI) adsorption to ferrihydrite-containing sorbents may be used as a method to bring down U(VI) concentrations to acceptable levels in groundwater.']\n",

Precipitation phase and duration of above-freezing air temperatures are shown to be major influences on divergence and convergence of modeled estimates of the subcanopy snowpack. When models are considered collectively at all locations, comparisons with observations show that it is harder to model SWE at forested sites than open sites. There is no universal \"best\\'\\' model for all sites or locations, but comparison of the consistency of individual model performances relative to one another at different sites shows that there is less consistency at forest sites than open sites, and even less consistency between forest and open sites in the same year. A good performance by a model at a forest site is therefore unlikely to mean a good model performance by the same model at an open site (and vice versa). Calibration of models at forest sites provides lower errors than uncalibrated models at three out of four locations. However, benefits of calibration do not translate to subsequent years, and benefits gained by models calibrated for forest snow processes are not translated to open conditions.']\n",

The metastable zone width has been determined at constant cooling rate, and the time and temperature of the preceding superheating step have been varied. m-Hydroxybenzoic acid has two polymorphs, and the influence of the polymorph used to prepare the solutions has also been investigated. There is an overall tendency in the experiments for the solution to exhibit a larger metastable zone width if it is superheated for a longer time and at a higher temperature, but under the investigated conditions this tendency is not very strong. The results show that the metastable form II preferentially crystallizes in all experiments and in particular when the solution has been more strongly superheated for several hours. However, when the time and/or the temperature of superheating is reduced, there is an increasing tendency to obtain the stable form I. This is most clearly found for solutions prepared by dissolving form I. When the solutions are prepared by dissolution of form II, this tendency is weaker in what appears to be a systematic way. It is hypothesized that, unless the solution is strongly superheated for several hours, it will contain for a significant period of time clusters of solute molecules that can retain some degree of structure from the dissolved crystal.

Solubility data in different solvents are used to estimate melting properties of the pure solid solutes, and are used to estimate the solid state Gibbs free energy relative to the super cooled melt. The relation to melting data experimentally determined is analysed, and solution activity coefficients are calculated. The work shows that there is a strong relation between solid-liquid solubility data and thermodynamic data of the pure solute. For these compounds, the melting temperature of the pure solute can be fairly accurately estimated by extrapolation of solid-liquid solubility data up to mole fraction equal unity. The estimation of the melting enthalpy is less successful showing deviations in the order of 20% to 30% from the experimental values determined by differential scanning calorimetry. For butyl paraben and benzoic acid, the best estimation of the solid state Gibbs free energy is obtained if DSC determination of melting properties is combined with an estimation of the melt-solid heat capacity difference versus temperature relation by correlation to solubility data.']\n",

Seeded transformation experiments were performed, and the solution concentration was monitored by in situ infrared spectroscopy using a calibration free method. Solid samples were also taken over time, and the percentage of metastable and stable polymorphic phases were determined using off line quantitative powder X-ray diffraction analysis. Solution and solid state data were compared for each compound. In the case of carbamazepine, the SMPT from FI to FIII was identified as being controlled by the growth of the stable FIII polymorph. For piracetam, the SMPT was also identified as being controlled by growth of the stable polymorph, but with a more considerable induction time for nucleation of the stable phase. This paper demonstrates how the rate determining steps of the SMPT can be identified if both solution and solid phase data are recorded. The results are compared with other studies reported in the literature and rationalized into four principal scenarios.']\n",

The work includes the 2 : 1 co-crystal of theophylline and oxalic acid, polymorphs of theophylline, the theophylline monohydrate and solid oxalic acid. The DSC curve of the co-crystal presents two endothermic peaks, one at about 230 degrees C where the oxalic acid in the co-crystal decomposes and carbon dioxide is liberated, and another one at 279 degrees C where the remaining theophylline melts. At equilibrium with the solid co-crystal, the theophylline concentration is only 60% of the corresponding value for the pure solid theophylline. Using the solubility data, the standard Gibbs free energy of formation of the co-crystal from the pure solid phases is estimated to be approximately -6.0 kJ mole(-1). In a chloroform/methanol mixture (4 : 1 v : v) the commercial form of pure theophylline (Form II) has been observed to transform into a more stable non-solvated form (Form I). The data suggest that the polymorphs are enantiotropically related with an approximate transition temperature of 70 degrees C.

It is found that the cocrystal physically decomposes at 120 degrees C (i.e., in the range between the melting points of the two pure compounds). The solubility of the cocrystal and pure compounds has been determined in chloroform and acetonitrile. In chloroform, the theophylline concentration of the saturated solution over the cocrystal is clearly higher than that in the saturated solution over pure theophylline I/II, while for glutaric acid the situation is the opposite. With the solubility data, the Gibbs free energy of the formation of the cocrystal from solid theophylline II and solid beta-glutaric acid at 30 degrees C can be estimated to -0.39 kJ mol(-1). The work reveals that polymorphism in the pure components of a cocrystal can dramatically influence the phase diagram and shift an incongruently dissolving case into a kinetically stabilized congruent case. In chloroform, the cocrystal dissolves incongruently with respect to the stable form I of theophylline but congruently with respect to the metastable theophylline II. However, the cocrystal is stable in a stoichiometric solution for more than 2 weeks. Given sufficient time, the system should transform into a solid phase being a mixture of cocrystal and stable theophylline I, in equilibrium with a solution that has the composition of the corresponding invariant point. In acetonitrile, where the glutaric acid solubility is much higher than that of theophylline II, the cocrystal dissolves, clearly incongruently. The region where the cocrystal is the only solid stable phase is clearly shifted toward the glutaric acid side and is fairly narrow. In both solvents the cocrystal can readily be produced by isothermal slurry conversion crystallization to a reasonable level of productivity, as long as the process is operated in a region of the phase diagram where the cocrystal is the only stable (or reasonably metastable) solid phase.']\n",

The effect of oxygen chemical potential and Fermi level on the formation energy and on the defect concentration have been taken into account. The formation of oxygen vacancies is found to be energetically more favorable in the cubic than in the monoclinic phase under the same oxygen chemical potential and Fermi energy. In both phases, substitutional Al decays from neutral charge state into the charge state -1, with the transition energy just above to the top of the valence band. Our findings indicate that by confining the Fermi energy to the region between the middle of the band gap and the bottom of the conduction band, high Al solubility could be achieved, although formation of Al is likely followed by the formation of interstitial oxygen. Furthermore, the concentration of Al with charge state -1 along with the equilibrium Fermi energy have been calculated in a self-consistent procedure. Here, the possible compensating defects with the relevant charge states have been considered. The obtained concentrations of Al and oxygen vacancies follow the experimental trend but underestimates experimental data. When the formation of defect clusters, composed by two substitutional Al and one oxygen vacancy, are considered, good quantitative agreement with experimental values of both Al and oxygen vacancy concentration is achieved. The results suggest that defect clusters will be formed as a result of Al doping in cubic phase of ZrO2, whereas the concentration of defect clusters is negligible in the monoclinic phase, both in accordance with experiment.']\n",

Today's wealth of sequenced genomes makes it increasingly important to understand evolutionary events such as duplications, losses, transpositions, inversions, lateral transfers, and domain shuffling. We focus on the gene duplication event, that constitutes a major force in the creation of genes with new function [Ohno 1970; Lynch and Force 2000] and, thereby also, of biodiversity. We introduce the probabilistic gene evolution model, which describes how a gene tree evolves within a given species tree with respect to speciation, gene duplication, and gene loss. The actual relation between gene tree and species tree is captured by a reconciliation, a concept which we generalize for more expressiveness. The model is a canonical generalization of the classical linear birth-death process, obtained by replacing the interval where the process takes place by a tree. For the gene evolution model, we derive efficient algorithms for some associated probability distributions: the probability of a reconciled tree, the probability of a gene tree, the maximum probability reconciliation, the posterior probability of a reconciliation, and sampling reconciliations with respect to the posterior probability. These algorithms provides the basis for several applications, including species tree construction, reconciliation analysis, orthology analysis, biogeography, and host-parasite co-evolution.\"]\n",

We first show that, if, for a sequence of interpolants, the values of the entropy gain of the interpolants converge to the optimum, then the interpolants converge in H-2, but not in H-infinity This result is then used to describe the asymptotic behavior of the interpolant as an interpolation point approaches the boundary of the domain of analyticity. For loop shaping to specifications in control design, it might at first seem natural to place strategically additional interpolation points close to the boundary. However, our results indicate that such a strategy will have little effect on the shape. Another consequence of our results relates to model reduction based on minimum-entropy principles, where one should avoid placing interpolation points too close to the boundary.']\n",

The core of these considerations consists in the fact that there exist regions in the phase space of Bianchi type VIII models where solutions can be approximated, to a high degree of accuracy, by type VI0 solutions. The behavior of solutions in these regions is essential for the question of 'locality', i.e., whether particle horizons form or not.

      "['A lipid core that occupies a high proportion of the plaque volume in addition to a thin fibrous cap is a predominant indicator of plaque vulnerability. Nowadays, noninvasive. imaging modalities can identify such structural components, however morphological criteria alone cannot reliably identify high-risk plaques. Information, such as stresses in the lesions components, seems to be essential. This work presents a methodology able to analyze the effect of changes in the lipid core and calcification on the wall stresses, in particular on the fibrous cap vulnerability. Using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging and histology of an ex vivo human atherosclerotic carotid bifurcation, a patient is gen-specific three-dimensional geometric model, consisting of four tissue components, erated. The adopted constitutive model accounts for the nonlinear and anisotropic tissue behavior incorporating the collagen fiber orientation by means of a novel and robust algorithm. The material parameters are identified from experimental data. A novel stress-based computational cap vulnerability index is proposed to assess quantitatively the rupture-risk of fibrous caps. Nonlinear finite element analyses identify that the highest stress regions are located at the vicinity of the shoulders of the fibrous cap and in the stiff calcified tissue. A parametric analysis reveals a positive correlation between the increase in lipid core portion and the mechanical stress in the fibrous cap and, hence, the risk for cap rupture. The highest values of the vulnerability index, which cot-relate to more vulnerable caps, are obtained for morphologies for which the lipid cores were severe; heavily loaded fibrous caps were thus detected. The proposed multidisciplinary methodology is able to investigate quantitatively the mechanical behavior of atherosclerotic plaques in patient-specific stenoses. The introduced vulnerability index may serve as a more quantitative tool for diagnosis, treatment and prevention. [DOI: 10.1115/1.']\n",

      "['Creating simulation models via composition of predefined and reusable components is an efficient way of reducing costs and time associated with the simulation model development. However, to successfully compose models one has to solve the issues of syntactic and semantic composability of components. The Base Object Model (BOM) standard is an attempt to ease reusability and composition of simulation models. However, the BOM does not contain sufficient information for defining necessary concepts and terms to avoid ambiguity, and neither does it have any method for dynamic aspects matching conceptual models (i.e., their state-machines). In this paper, we present our approach for enhancement of the semantic contents of BOMs and propose a three-layer model for syntactic and semantic matching of BOMs. The enhancement includes ontologies for entities, events and interactions in each component. We also present an OWL-S description for each component, including the state-machines. To test our approach, we specify some simulation scenarios and implement BOMs as building blocks for development of those scenarios, one of which is presented in this paper. We also define composability degree, which quantifies closeness of the composed model to a given model specification. Our results show that the three-layer model is promising and can improve and simplify the composition of BOM-based components.']\n",

Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol 298: H898-H912, 2010. First published December 24, 2009; doi:10.1152/ajpheart.00378.2009.-Specimens of intact wall tubes of human common carotid arteries (CCA), internal carotid arteries (ICA) (n = 11, age 77.6 yr, SD 6.3), and related adventitia and media-intima tubes are mechanically examined. Cyclic, quasi-static extension-inflation tests at different axial stretches are performed on preconditioned tube specimens. Stress-free configurations show significant stress releases in the circumferential direction of the intact CCA and ICA walls and in the axial directions of the intact CCA walls and the CCA and ICA adventitias. All investigated tissues exhibit strong nonlinear, pseudoelastic mechanical behavior with small hysteresis. The \"inversion\" feature, where the pressure/axial stretch relationship becomes a vertical line, is found only for intact walls. Axial \"inversion stretches\" are 1.15 (SD 0.06) for CCA and 1.14 (SD 0.06) for ICA, and related external axial forces are 0.43 N (SD 0.15) and 0.30 N (SD 0.22), respectively. Significant negative correlations between age and axial inversion stretches for CCA (r = -0.67, P = 0.03) and ICA (r = -0.29, P = 0.04) are identified. Adventitias are very compliant at low pressures, but change into stiff tubes at high pressures. The burst pressure of the adventitia is beyond 250 kPa. A relatively low burst pressure of similar to 60 kPa is found in the media-intima tubes, in which the pressure/circumferential stretch relationships are almost independent of the axial stretches. Stress analyses indicate a high degree of material anisotropy for all investigated tissues. High circumferential and axial stresses occur in the media-intima tubes at physiological conditions. The obtained data are intended to serve for an improvement of constitutive laws, determination of constitutive parameters, and enhancing our knowledge of the mechanical functions of arteries and their associated layers in specific pathophysiological and clinical problems, such as hypertension and angioplasty with stenting.']\n",

      "[\"In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for recovery of low-rank matrices from compressed linear measurements. The underlying idea of this algorithm is to closely approximate the rank function with a smooth function of singular values, and then minimize the resulting approximation subject to the linear constraints. The accuracy of the approximation is controlled via a scaling parameter Î´, where a smaller Î´ corresponds to a more accurate fitting. The consequent optimization problem for any finite Î´ is nonconvex. Therefore, to decrease the risk of ending up in local minima, a series of optimizations is performed, starting with optimizing a rough approximation (a large Î´) and followed by successively optimizing finer approximations of the rank with smaller Î´'s. To solve the optimization problem for any Î´ &gt; 0, it is converted to a new program in which the cost is a function of two auxiliary positive semidefinite variables. The paper shows that this new program is concave and applies a majorize-minimize technique to solve it which, in turn, leads to a few convex optimization iterations. This optimization scheme is also equivalent to a reweighted Nuclear Norm Minimization (NNM). For any Î´ &gt; 0, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the exact recovery which are weaker than those corresponding to NNM. On the numerical side, the proposed algorithm is compared to NNM and a reweighted NNM in solving affine rank minimization and matrix completion problems showing its considerable and consistent superiority in terms of success rate.\"]\n",

We combine beamforming with full-rate high dimensional real-valued orthogonal space time block coding (OSTBC) to increase the number of beamforming weight vectors and associated degrees of freedom in the beamformer design. The original multi-constraint beamforming problem is converted into a convex optimization problem using semidefinite relaxation (SDR) which can be solved efficiently. In contrast to conventional (rank-one) beamforming approaches in which an optimal beamforming solution can be obtained only when the SDR solution (after rank reduction) exhibits the rank-one property, in our approach optimality is guaranteed when a rank of eight is not exceeded. We show that our approach can incorporate up to 79 additional shaping constraints for which an optimal beamforming solution is guaranteed as compared to a maximum of two additional constraints that bound the conventional rank-one downlink beamforming designs.

The study of the convergenceproperties of these methods is in general difficult due to thenonconvexity of the problem. In this paper, two distributedsolution methods that combine the fast convergence propertiesof augmented Lagrangian-based methods with the separabilityproperties of alternating optimization are investigated. The firstmethod is adapted from the classic quadratic penalty functionmethod and is called the Alternating Direction Penalty Method(ADPM). Unlike the original quadratic penalty function method,in which single-step optimizations are adopted, ADPM uses analternating optimization, which in turn makes it scalable. Thesecond method is the well-known Alternating Direction Methodof Multipliers (ADMM). It is shown that ADPM for nonconvexproblems asymptotically converges to a primal feasible pointunder mild conditions and an additional condition ensuringthat it asymptotically reaches the standard first order necessary conditions for local optimality are introduced. In thecase of the ADMM, novel sufficient conditions under whichthe algorithm asymptotically reaches the standard first ordernecessary conditions are established. Based on this, completeconvergence of ADMM for a class of low dimensional problemsare characterized.

      "['Computational methods are proposed for solving a convex quadratic program (QP). Active-set methods are defined for a particular primal and dual formulation of a QP with general equality constraints and simple lower bounds on the variables. In the first part of the paper, two methods are proposed, one primal and one dual. These methods generate a sequence of iterates that are feasible with respect to the equality constraints associated with the optimality conditions of the primal-dual form. The primal method maintains feasibility of the primal inequalities while driving the infeasibilities of the dual inequalities to zero. The dual method maintains feasibility of the dual inequalities while moving to satisfy the primal inequalities. In each of these methods, the search directions satisfy a KKT system of equations formed from Hessian and constraint components associated with an appropriate column basis. The composition of the basis is specified by an active-set strategy that guarantees the nonsingularity of each set of KKT equations. Each of the proposed methods is a conventional active-set method in the sense that an initial primal- or dual-feasible point is required. In the second part of the paper, it is shown how the quadratic program may be solved as a coupled pair of primal and dual quadratic programs created from the original by simultaneously shifting the simple-bound constraints and adding a penalty term to the objective function. Any conventional column basis may be made optimal for such a primal-dual pair of shifted-penalized problems. The shifts are then updated using the solution of either the primal or the dual shifted problem. An obvious application of this approach is to solve a shifted dual QP to define an initial feasible point for the primal (or vice versa). The computational performance of each of the proposed methods is evaluated on a set of convex problems from the CUTEst test collection.']\n",

The LAT was built by an international collaboration with contributions from space agencies, high-energy particle physics institutes, and universities in France, Italy, Japan, Sweden, and the United States. This paper describes the LAT, its preflight expected performance, and summarizes the key science objectives that will be addressed. On-orbit performance will be presented in detail in a subsequent paper. The LAT is a pair-conversion telescope with a precision tracker and calorimeter, each consisting of a 4 x 4 array of 16 modules, a segmented anticoincidence detector that covers the tracker array, and a programmable trigger and data acquisition system. Each tracker module has a vertical stack of 18 (x, y) tracking planes, including two layers (x and y) of single-sided silicon strip detectors and high-Z converter material (tungsten) per tray. Every calorimeter module has 96 CsI(Tl) crystals, arranged in an eight-layer hodoscopic configuration with a total depth of 8.6 radiation lengths, giving both longitudinal and transverse information about the energy deposition pattern. The calorimeter's depth and segmentation enable the high-energy reach of the LAT and contribute significantly to background rejection. The aspect ratio of the tracker (height/width) is 0.4, allowing a large FoV (2.4 sr) and ensuring that most pair-conversion showers initiated in the tracker will pass into the calorimeter for energy measurement. Data obtained with the LAT are intended to (1) permit rapid notification of high-energy gamma-ray bursts and transients and facilitate monitoring of variable sources, (2) yield an extensive catalog of several thousand high-energy sources obtained from an all-sky survey, (3) measure spectra from 20 MeV to more than 50 GeV for several hundred sources, (4) localize point sources to 0.3-2 arcmin, (5) map and obtain spectra of extended sources such as SNRs, molecular clouds, and nearby galaxies, (6) measure the diffuse isotropic gamma-ray background up to TeV energies, and (7) explore the discovery space for dark matter.\"]\n",

The molecular structures of 3a, 3b, 4a, 4b, as well as [3aH(N)][OTf] and [3bH(N)][OTf] were confirmed by X-ray diffraction studies, which show that the Ph2PCH2Py ligand occupies the basal position both in 3a and its protonated species [3aH(N)][OTf], while the Ph2PPy ligand prefers the apical position in 3b and [3bH(N)][OTf]. The double protonation process of complex 4b was monitored by in situ IR, H-1 and P-31 NMR spectroscopy at low temperature. The spectroscopic evidence indicates that the protonation of 4b occurs first at the Fe-Fe bond and then at the pyridyl-nitrogen atom. Cyclic voltammograms reveal that protonation of 3a and 3b results in a considerable decrease in the overpotential for electrocatalytic proton reduction in the presence of HOTf, while the efficiency is not influenced by protonation. The electrocatalytic efficiency of 4a for proton reduction in the presence of HOAc in CH3CN-H2O (50:1, v/v) is 5 times higher than that in pure CH3CN.']\n",

Effects due to electron-donating groups (EDGs) on the diene, as well as electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) on the dienophile, have also been studied. Organic catalysts such as thioureas are known to lower the activation energy through hydrogen-bonding to the carbonyl oxygen, in a way that mimics the oxyanion holes of hydrolytic enzymes. EDGs and EWGs were found to further activate the reaction, and the catalyst showed a synergistic behavior towards the EDGs. Polar solvents were found to reduce the overall activation energy, but also the relative catalytic effect of the thiourea, in accordance with experimental studies. The substituent-mediated reactions displayed more asynchronous transition structures with lower activation energy, which led us to investigate the possibility of an alternative two-step, Michael-type route, similar to what has been found in macrophomate synthase. Although the concerted Diels-Alder route was found to be favored over the Michael route, the calculated activation energy difference is less than 1 kcal mol(-1), which suggests that the two mechanisms compete, and could be responsible for the particular stereochemical outcome of an experiment.']\n",

It helps to identify appropriate tools and their use in the process, and to systematise the use of available data and knowledge across the planning organization and process. It distinguishes three stages in follow-up: scoping, analysis and learning, identifies the key functions and demonstrates the informational linkages to the strategic decision-making process. The associated tool kit includes specific analytical and deliberative tools. Many of these are applicable also ex ante. but are then used in a predictive mode rather than on the basis of real data.

In other words: What is the state-of-the-art in the area?. To gain an insight into these questions, we have conducted an in-depth analysis of three of the major open source workflow management systems - jBPM, OpenWFE, and Enhydra Shark, the results of which are reported here. This analysis is based on the workflow patterns framework and provides a continuation of the series of evaluations performed using the same framework on closed source systems, business process modelling languages, and web-service composition standards. The results from evaluations of the three open source systems are compared with each other and also with the results from evaluations of three representative closed source systems: Staffware, WebSphere MQ and Oracle BPEL PM. The overall conclusion is that open source systems are targeted more toward developers rather than business analysts.

Assuming that this depletion is a signature of the presence of charged dust particles, the main characteristics of dust down to submicron sized particles are derived. The differential size distribution is found to be well described by a power law with an index mu similar to 5.5-6 for the lower size limit a(min) = 0.03 mu m and mu similar to 7.3-8 for a(min) = 0.1 mu m. The calculated average integral dust number density is weakly affected by values of mu and a(min). For a greater than or similar to 0.1 mu m, both flybys gave the maximum dust density about 0.1-0.3 cm(-3) in the vicinity of Enceladus.

A quasi-static electric field structure with a downward parallel electric field forms at altitudes between 800 km and 5000 km, accelerating ionospheric electrons upward, away from the auroral ionosphere. A wealth of related phenomena, including energetic ion conics, electron solitary waves, low-frequency wave activity, and plasma density cavities occur in this region, which also acts as a source region for VLF saucers. Results are presented from sounding rockets and satellites, such as Freja, FAST, Viking, and Cluster, to illustrate the characteristics of the electric fields and related parameters, at altitudes below, within, and above the acceleration region. Special emphasis will be on the high-altitude characteristics and dynamics of quasi-static electric field structures observed by Cluster. These structures, which extend up to altitudes of at least 4-5 Earth radii, appear commonly as monopolar or bipolar electric fields. The former are found to occur at sharp boundaries, such as the polar cap boundary whereas the bipolar fields occur at soft plasma boundaries within the plasma sheet. The temporal evolution of quasi-static electric field structures, as captured by the pearls-on-a-string configuration of the Cluster spacecraft indicates that the formation of the electric field structures and of ionospheric plasma density cavities are closely coupled processes.

However, exceptions are also found where small-scale electric fields couple perfectly between the ionosphere and Cluster altitudes.

      "['Auroral arcs are typically described in terms of an upward field-aligned current (FAC) sheet above the arc, connected by ionospheric Pedersen current to a downward FAC sheet near the arc. On the basis of data measured by the FAST spacecraft, conjugate with ground optical observations, we present first a wide and stable winter evening arc, where this standard model does not apply. The arc is observed in the Harang region during the growth phase of a modest substorm, poleward of the convection reversal (CR) boundary. Although the magnetic field data suggest the typical configuration, the two FAC sheets appear to be decoupled near the satellite footprint: the upward FAC is fed by the westward electrojet (WEJ), while the downward FAC feeds the eastward electrojet (EEJ). The examination of the arc by the newly developed ALADYN technique confirms this peculiar current topology. For comparison, we apply ALADYN also to a second evening arc, located within the Harang region equatorward from the CR. The arc is confirmed to have the standard configuration, consistent with a former study, but substantial FAC-EJ coupling is inferred in the auroral oval both poleward and equatorward of the arc. A key element for the topology of the current closure is the westward component of the electric field, which influences the relative location of the CR with respect to the large-scale FAC reversal (FR) boundary. As proved by tests on synthetic data, a westward component of the electric field pushes the CR toward the FR, preventing thus the standard FAC closure, while the conductance and FAC pattern shape the CR profile. Since a westward electric field is often measured in the Harang region, the FAC-EJ coupling is expected to be an essential ingredient there. This has important implications for the current closure in the equatorial magnetosphere and for the auroral current circuit in the WEJ region, closely related to the substorm process.']\n",

For upward currents, the coupling can be expressed analytically, using the linear current-voltage relation, as outlined by Weimer et al. (1985). This gives a scale size dependent coupling where structures are coupled (decoupled) above (below) a critical scale size. For downward currents, the current-voltage relation is highly non-linear which complicates the understanding of how the coupling works. Results from this experimental study indicate that small-scale structures are decoupled, similar to small-scale structures in the upward current region.

The spatial and temporal development of the acceleration structures is studied, given the magnetic conjunction opportunity and the one minute difference between the Cluster spacecraft crossings. The configuration allowed for estimation of characteristic times of development for the two structures and of the parallel electric field and potential drop for the more stable one. The first potential structure had a width of similar to 80 km (projected to the ionosphere) and was relatively short-lived, developing in less than 40 s and decaying in one minute. The parallel potential drop increased between altitudes of 1.13 R(E) and 1.3 R(E), whereas the acceleration potential above 1.3 R(E) remained almost unchanged during that time. This intensification occurred mainly after the time when the associated upward current had reached its maximum value. The second structure had a width of similar to 50 km and was subject to an increase by a factor of 3 of the parallel potential drop below 1.3 R(E), during about 40 s, after which it remained rather stable for one minute or more. Similarly here, the acceleration potential above 1.3 R(E) remained roughly unchanged.

The particle and field data are used to infer the acceleration potentials of the arcs and their distribution in altitude and latitude. The C1 data are consistent with a symmetric potential pattern, composed of two negative U potentials and one positive U potential in between, and the C3 and C4 data are consistent with an asymmetric pattern, where the dominating potential structure extends deep into the polar cap boundary (PCB) region. The two patterns may either correspond to different stages of evolution of the same double arc system or represent two longitudinally separated double arc systems. For all spacecraft, the potential well of the poleward arc extends into the PCB region, whereas the density cavity does not but remains confined to R1. This suggests that the Alfvenic activity observed within the PCB region prevents the cavity formation, consistent with the associated FACs being roughly balanced over this region. The results show that Alfvenic and quasi-static acceleration operates jointly in the PCB region, varying from being about equally important (on C1) to being predominantly quasi-static (on C3/C4). The presence (absence) of an upward electron beam, associated with a positive potential structure and a downward current, observed by C1 (C4/C3) is expected from its short life time, shorter than the time lag between the Cluster spacecraft. The evolution involves both a broadening and a density reduction of the associated downward current sheet to below the critical current density above which parallel electric fields will form. The deepest potential well of 13 kV observed by C4 was located in Region 1, adjacent to the PCB region and coinciding with the deepest density cavity, with a minimum density of 0.1 cm(-3). The interface between Region 1 and the PCB region, coinciding with the steep density gradient, appears to be the leading edge of the cavity.']\n",

This configuration of the auroral current circuit was introduced by Bostrom (1964) and labeled as \"Type 2,\" while he suggested also an alternative \"Type 1\" configuration, with filamentary FACs connected in the ionosphere by azimuthal Pedersen currents. By using an updated version of the recently developed ALADYN technique, we investigated the divergence of the auroral electrojets for a few FAST crossings over the auroral oval in the 20-22 MLT sector, two of which are presented in detail. Although a precise estimate of the electrojet divergence is difficult, because of several error sources, the results suggest that this divergence can be significant over certain latitude ranges, comparable with the FAC density. Direct FAC-EJ coupling appears to contribute to the ionospheric current closure not only during active times, as already known, but also during rather quiet periods. The quiet time FAC-EJ coupling is likely to be achieved in a mixed \"Type 1/Type 2\" configuration, with the FAC sheet (Type 1) azimuthally connected to the Pedersen component of the EJ (Type 2). This configuration requires a non-zero tangential component of the electric field, and is therefore more likely realized inside or near the Harang region. At the same time, the divergence of the Hall current is presumably negligible, and likewise the ionospheric polarization, consistent with statistical results published recently. During more active intervals and possible reconfigurations of the auroral current circuit, our results suggest that the FAC-EJ coupling could be also achieved by Hall currents. We conclude by exploring a tentative scenario for the integrated evolution of the ionospheric current closure and Cowling mechanism during the substorm cycle. A systematic examination of more experimental evidence is needed to validate this scenario.']\n",

Micrographic and microsegregation analysis on samples extracted from a breakout shell revealed high ratios of primary-precipitated austenite in the thick sections of the shell, and high ratios of primary-precipitated ferrite in the thin sections. Alternating precipitations of austenite and ferrite are proposed to occur during solidification. Regions of the shell with high ratios of primary austenite remain in contact with the mould and exhibit high growth rates, whereas regions with high ratios of primary ferrite shrink in volume due to the ferrite to austenite transformation, which results in the formation of air gaps between the shell and the mould and reductions in growth rate.']\n",

The study includes modeling of coupled thermal-hydrological-mechanical (THM) processes, with simplified consideration of chemical coupling in terms of time-dependent strength degradation or subcritical crack growth. The different model approaches applied in this study include boundary element, finite element, finite difference, particle mechanics, and elasto-plastic cellular automata methods. The simulation results indicate that thermally induced differential stresses near the top of the emplacement drift may cause progressive failure and permeability changes during the first 100 years (i.e., after emplacement and drift closure). Moreover, the results indicate that time-dependent mechanical changes may play only a small role during the first 100 years of increasing temperature and thermal stress, whereas such time-dependency is insignificant after peak temperature, because of decreasing thermal stress.']\n",

      "['The mechanical testing of anisotropic nonlinearly elastic solids is a topic of considerable and increasing interest. The results of such testing are important, in particular, for the characterization of the material properties and the development of constitutive laws that can be used for predictive purposes. However, the literature on this topic in the context of soft tissue biomechanics, in particular, includes some papers that are misleading since they contain errors and false statements. Claims that planar biaxial testing can fully characterize the three-dimensional anisotropic elastic properties of soft tissues are incorrect. There is therefore a need to clarify the extent to which biaxial testing can be used for determining the elastic properties of these materials. In this paper this is explained on the basis of the equations of finite deformation transversely isotropic elasticity, and general planar anisotropic elasticity. It is shown that it is theoretically impossible to fully characterize the properties of anisotropic elastic materials using such tests unless some assumption is made that enables a suitable subclass of models to be preselected. Moreover, it is shown that certain assumptions underlying the analysis of planar biaxial tests are inconsistent with the classical linear theory of orthotropic elasticity. Possible sets of independent tests required for full material characterization are then enumerated.']\n",

The stable site occupancy at 300 K is determined by comparing the free energies of the alloys with different site-occupation configurations. It is shown that, for most of the off-stoichiometric Ni2MnGa, the \"normal\" site occupation is favorable, i.e., the excess atoms of the rich component occupy the sublattice(s) of the deficient one(s). Nevertheless, for the Ga-rich alloys, the excess Ga atoms have strong tendency to take the Mn sublattice no matter if Mn is deficient or not. Based on the determined site occupancy, the elastic moduli of the off-stoichiometric Ni2MnGa are calculated. We find that, in general, the bulk modulus increases with increasing e/a ratio (i.e., the number of valence electrons per atom). The shear moduli C-\\' and C-44 change oppositely with e/a ratio: C-\\' decreases but C-44 increases with increasing e/a. However, the Mn-rich Ga-deficient alloys deviate significantly from this general trend. The correlation of calculated elastic moduli and available experimental martensitic transformation temperatures (T-M) demonstrates that the alloy with larger C-\\' than that of the perfect Ni2MnGa generally possesses lower T-M except for Ni2Mn1+xGa1-x.']\n",

The two transitions occur at pressures of 8 GPa and 105 GPa, accompanied by volume collapses of 8.4% and 1.2%, respectively. The energy band gap increases with pressure in the (Fm (3) over barm) and the forepart of Pnma phases. However, on increasing the pressure beyond 60 GPa, the gap decreases, which is due to the fluorine p(z)-states shifting toward the Fermi energy. In addition, the elastic properties versus pressure are also discussed. Our calculated elastic constants for the cubic phase at ambient pressure are in agreement with the experimental values. The stress-strain coefficient calculations show that shear transformations in the Pnma phase are more difficult than in the cubic phase and the compressibility along the c(h) (or a(o)) direction for the orthorhombic phase is stronger than that in the hexagonal crystal.']\n",

While most methods are constructed for plasma depletion, there is a need for body-fluid-specific strategies. The aim of the present study was to design an affinity matrix suitable for the depletion of high-abundance proteins in CSIF (cerebrospinal fluid). Hence, molecules with specific affinity towards proteins present at high concentration in CSIF were desired. Affibody(R) molecules are specific binders of small size that have shown high stability under various conditions and are therefore good candidates for such a matrix. The protein composition in CSF resembles that in plasma. However, 20 % of the proteins are brain-derived and are therefore present in higher proportions in CSF than in plasma, whereas larger plasma-derived proteins are less abundant in CSF. Therefore five high-abundance CSIF proteins were chosen for the design of a CSF-specific depletion setup. Affibody(R) molecules with specificity towards HSA (human serum albumin), IgG, transferrin and transthyretin were combined in an affinity column. In addition, polyclonal antibodies against cystatin C were coupled to chromatographic beads and packed in a separate column.

By extending the size of the computational domain, and include more than one element, phase shifts corresponding to invisible space are included.']\n",

For the Lipschitz coefficient case one can apply a monotonicity formula to prove the C-1,C-1-regularity of the solution and that the free boundary is, near the so-called branching points, the union of two C-1-graphs. In our case, the same monotonicity formula does not apply in the same way. In the absence of a monotonicity formula, we use a specific scaling argument combined with the classification of certain global solutions to obtain C-1,C-1-estimates.

      "['We present a technique for describing the global behaviour of complex nonlinear flows by decomposing the flow into modes determined from spectral analysis of the Koopman operator, an infinite-dimensional linear operator associated with the full nonlinear system. These modes, referred to as Koopman modes, are associated with a particular observable, and may be determined directly from data (either numerical or experimental) using a variant of a standard Arnoldi method. They have an associated temporal frequency and growth rate and may be viewed as a nonlinear generalization of global eigenmodes of a linearized system. They provide an alternative to proper orthogonal decomposition, and in the case of periodic data the Koopman modes reduce to a discrete temporal Fourier transform. The Arnoldi method used for computations is identical to the dynamic mode decomposition recently proposed by Schmid &amp; Sesterhenn (Sixty-First Annual Meeting of the APS Division of Fluid Dynamics, 2008), so dynamic mode decomposition can be thought of as an algorithm for finding Koopman modes. We illustrate the method on an example of a jet in crossflow, and show that the method captures the dominant frequencies and elucidates the associated spatial structures.']\n",

This paper presents a digital image correlation (DIC) system for non-contact and full strain field measurements, conceived for the purpose of investigating the cracking behavior of HMA mixtures. The whole system was developed so as to account for the special nature of typical HMA testing configurations.

Binder properties were evaluated using different types of laboratory equipment, such as dynamic shear rheometer (DSR), bending beam rheometer (BBR), differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), as well as equipment for determining more conventional parameters. Asphalt concrete properties were evaluated at low temperatures using the tensile strain restrained specimen test (TSRST) and creep test at -25 degrees C At higher temperatures, dynamic creep testing was performed at 40 degrees C, and complex modulus tests between 0 and 20 degrees C Binder test results indicated that the magnitude and type of effect on bitumen rheology depend on the bitumen itself hype of crystallizing fraction in the bitumen and for type and amount of additive used. Adding polyethylene wax, showed no or positive effects on the rheological behaviour at low temperatures (decrease in stiffness) as well as medium and high temperatures (increase in complex modulus and decrease in phase angle). However, the corresponding positive effects could not be shown in dynamic creep testing (at 40 degrees C) of asphalt concrete mixtures containing these modified binders. Adding FT-paraffin decreased the physical hardening index (obtained using BBR) for all bitumens. Also polyethylene war and montan wax showed this effect for some bitumens. Slack wax showed a large increasing effect on physical hardening. No correlation between physical hardening index (PHI) and wax content by DSC was found in this study.

Effects of adding two commercial waxes to one polymer modified bitumen have been studied.

Moreover, there is a stiffening effect at medium and high temperatures (below placing temperature), indicating a certain positive effect on stability. Concerning low temperature performance, there are results indicating some negative impact on crack susceptibility at low temperatures, more by the addition of one of the waxes than by addition of the other.

The first considers how to identify separate local housing markets, with the use of a regression-tree approach, and the second concerns when it is possible to update a price index, with a recursive regression approach. Finally, the question about seasonal adjustment is investigated. Findings: Overall, the hedonic approach is the best method to use. Moreover, the County of Stockholm is not one market in the sense that the market can be represented by only one property price index. It can be best described as a number of different sub-markets where the property prices grow differently.

The problem of estimating such second order statistics of MIMO channels, based on limited amounts of training data, is treated in this article. It is assumed that the Kronecker model holds. This implies that the channel covariance is the Kronecker product of one covariance matrix that is associated with the array and the scattering at the transmitter and one that is associated with the receive array and the scattering at the receiver. The proposed estimator uses training data from a number of signal blocks (received during independent fades of the MIMO channel) to compute the estimate. This is in contrast to methods that assume that the channel realizations are directly available, or possible to estimate almost without error. It is also demonstrated how methods that make use of the training data indirectly via channel estimates can be biased. An estimator is derived that can, in an asymptotically optimal way, use, not only the structure implied by the Kronecker assumption, but also linear structure on the transmit- and receive covariance matrices. The performance of the proposed estimator is analyzed and numerical simulations illustrate the results and also provide insight into the small sample behaviour of the proposed method.']\n",

Decent control of the polymerization was achieved with PMDETA as ligand reaching PDIs of 1.4 for the solution polymerization of GMA. When microspheres were present, the polymerization was less controlled with higher PDIs. The epoxide groups of the grafted microspheres were hydrolyzed by HCl in THF providing a hydrophilic surface of the microsphere. The expansion property of the microspheres was studied after each reaction step by thermal mechanical analysis, and it was found that the expansion capacity was well preserved with only limited negative effect on the microspheres.']\n",

The cross-linked copolymers formed a durable film with a degree of crystallinity depending on the macromonomer size and amount of CA-dE used, without CA-dE the macromonomers homopolymerized only to a low degree. Combined with CA-dE conversions of 85-90% were determined by FT-Raman spectroscopy.

The polymers displayed similar sizes by size exclusion chromatography analyses, but also exhibited some physical and chemical differences.

Through a second modification reaction between the HEMA-modified AcGGM (M-AcGGM-methacrylated AcGGM) and maleic anhydride, a \"double-modified\" AcGGM (CM-AcGGM-carboxylated M-AcGGM) was successfuly, formed that could be cross-linked to form ionic hydrogels by the very same polymerization method. The neutral hydrogels showed drug release kinetics that could be easily regulated by changing the relative amount of the methacrylated AcGGM and its corresponding degree of methacrylation. The drug release rate and the Fickian swelling cl creased with an increase in these two aforementioned parameters. The ionic hydrogels showed quicker release kinetics and higher swelling capabilities than the corresponding nonionic gels did, especially at neutral conditions.

In electrified railway networks series and shunt devices (whose circuit models derived either from experiments/borrowed off the shelf), e.g., transformers, converters, switchgear, signal equipments, etc., are found distributed along the MTL system. To simulate such railway systems involving both transmission lines (TL) and lumped circuits, an interface technique between TL system solved using FDTD and all the lumped circuits solved using ATP/EMTP software (circuit solver) is proposed. This sufficiently accurate method is simple to apply as only instantaneous voltages and currents are transmitted between standalone FDTD routine and circuit solver. Moreover, the user avoids coding complex circuit models within the FDTD, while at the same time efficiently uses the potential of accurate frequency dependant loss models (nonexistent in circuit software) coded in FDTD. The technique is applied on typical electrified railway systems to demonstrate how traction transformers, track circuits, and line interconnections affect the propagating voltages and currents. The method could be beneficial for transient protection and insulation coordination studies in electrified railway systems.']\n",

Back-scattered power, attenuation coefficient and phase velocity of ultrasonic waves propagating through suspensions of PVA contrast agents were measured at temperature values ranging between 24 degrees C and 37 degrees C in a frequency range from 3 MHz to 13 MHz. Enhancement of the backscattered power higher than 20 dB and displaying a weak dependence on temperature was observed. Attenuation and phase velocity, on the other hand, showed higher sensitivity to temperature variations. A modified version of the Church model, which accounts for the dispersion of the dynamic modulus of the PVA shells, was developed to simultaneously fit the attenuation and phase velocity data at 24 degrees C. The frequency dependence of the storage modulus was found to be that of semiflexible polymeric networks. On the other hand, the frequency dependence of the dynamic loss modulus suggests that additional mechanisms, which may be related to the finite dimensions of the shell and/or to its inhomogeneity, may play a significant role in the dissipation of the acoustic energy. For the microbubbles of interest, this model predicts frequency dependent resonance frequency higher than 100 MHz.']\n",

      "[\"A nonlinear rubber material model is presented, where influences of frequency and dynamic amplitude are taken into account through fractional order viscoelasticity and plasticity, respectively. The problem of simultaneously modeling elastic, viscoelastic, and friction contributions is removed by additively splitting them. Due to the fractional order representation mainly, the number of parameters of the model remains low, rendering an easy fitting of the values from tests on material samples. The proposed model is implemented in a general-purpose finite element (FE) code. Since commercial FE codes do not contain any suitable constitutive model that represents the full dynamic behavior of rubber compounds (including frequency and amplitude dependent effects), a simple approach is used based on the idea of adding stress contributions from simple constitutive models: a mesh overlay technique, whose basic idea is to create a different FE model for each material definition (fractional derivative viscoelastic and elastoplastic), all with identical meshes but with different material definition, and sharing the same nodes. Fractional-derivative viscoelasticity is implemented through user routines and the algorithm for that purpose is described, while available von Mises' elastoplastic models are adopted to take rate-independent effects into account. Satisfactory results are obtained when comparing the model results with tests carried out in two rubber bushings at a frequency range up to 500 Hz, showing the ability of the material model to accurately describe the complex dynamic behavior of carbon-black filled rubber compounds.\"]\n",

Based on the calculated induced charge densities, expressions to calculate the DEP force and torque are obtained. The calculated induced charge density of a prolate ellipsoid under a uniform electric field is compared with the analytic solution and an excellent agreement is achieved. The smaller the slenderness (the ratio of maximum radius to length of the slender body), the smaller the error is. The DEP force that a prolate ellipsoid experiences in a general electric field is numerically calculated and compared with the results obtained by the commonly accepted effective dipole moment method. The current model is expected to possess higher accuracy than the effective dipole moment method and to demand less calculation work than the Maxwell stress tensor method.']\n",

The largest part of the collected plastic municipal solid waste fraction consists of packaging materials, e.g., polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene. A major drawback to the increased use of recycled polymers is the lack of knowledge about the property changes and the overall quality of the recyclates, e.g., the degree of degradation, mixing, and contamination. This article presents a test protocol for description of the mechanical, physical, and chemical property changes during recycling and service life by combining several reprocessing cycles and thermo-oxidation. The test protocol was designed to mimic the degradation mechanisms potentially occurring in the materials during the service life and the reprocessing. Virgin PP and HDPE were multiply processed by injection molding. Service life of plastic materials was modeled by accelerated thermal degradation of one time processed materials. Tensile testing, MFR, HT-SEC, DSC, FTIR, and SEM were used to analyze material changes. In parallel, a set of industrially recycled PP and HDPE were also subjected to the same analyses. The results proved that recycled plastics maintain the majority of the material properties even when reprocessed several times. It was demonstrated that the mechanical and thermal properties of PP and HDPE were preserved also after several reprocessing steps. Initiation of degradation was observed for PP but not for HDPE. A decrease in M of PP from 240,000 to 190,000 (six times reprocessed) was established, this corresponds to an increase in MFR from 8 to 18 g/10 min.

Furthermore, significant changes in the topography were detected by FE-SEM, indicating the initiation of degradation. No significant changes in the contact angle of the in vivo used samples were observed, but this information may be shielded by the fact that biofilm may remain on the surface, despite the thorough cleaning before the analysis.

Since then new noninvasive methods have been developed. A recently developed ultrasound technique to estimate tissue motion and deformation is speckle-tracking echocardiography. Speckle tracking-based techniques allow for accurate measurement of movement and deformation variables in the arterial wall in both the radial and the longitudinal direction. The aim of this study was to test if speckle tracking-derived deformation data could be used as input for wave intensity calculations. The new concept was to approximate changes of flow and pressure by deformation changes of the arterial wall in longitudinal and radial directions. Flow changes (dU/dt) were approximated by strain rate (sr, 1/s) of the arterial wall in the longitudinal direction, whereas pressure changes (dP/dt) were approximated by sign reversed strain rate (1/s) in the arterial wall in the radial direction. To validate the new concept, a comparison between the newly developed Wave Intensity Wall Analysis (WIWA) algorithm and a commonly used and validated wave intensity system (SSD-5500, Aloka, Tokyo, Japan) was performed. The studied population consisted of ten healthy individuals (three women, seven men) and ten patients (all men) with coronary artery disease.

Even thou quantitative methods are well validated and from many reasons preferable, the feasibility of visual assessment (eyeballing) is superior. There is to date only sparse data comparing visual EF assessment in comparison to quantitative methods available.

Intraobserver variability was 3.8% for eyeballing 2DE, 3.2% for eyeballing TP and 2.3% for quantitative 3D-EF.

      "['Background: Tissue Doppler (TD) in pulsed mode (spectral TD) and colour TD are the two modalities today available in tissue velocity echocardiography (TVE). Previous studies have shown poor agreement between these two methods when measuring myocardial velocities and displacement. In this study, the concordance between the myocardial velocity and displacement measurements using colour TD and different spectral TD procedures was evaluated. Methods: Left ventricular (LV) longitudinal systolic myocardial velocities and displacement during ejection period were quantified at the basal septal and lateral wall in 24 healthy individuals (4 women and 20 men, 34 +/- 12 years) using spectral TD, colour TD and M-mode recordings. Mean, maximal and minimal spectral TD systolic velocities and the corresponding displacement values were obtained by measurements at the outer and inner borders of the spectral velocity signal. The results were then compared with those obtained with the two other modalities used. Results: Systolic myocardial velocities derived from mean spectral TD frequencies were highly concordant with corresponding colour TD measurements (mean difference 0.10 +/- 0.54 cm/sec in septal and 0.09 +/- 0.97 cm/sec in lateral wall). Similarly, the agreement between spectral and colour TD (mean difference 0.22 +/- 0.74 mm in septal and 0.02 +/- 0.86 mm in lateral wall) as well as M-mode was good when mean spectral velocities were temporally integrated and the results did not differ statistically. Conversely, displacement values from the inner or outer border of the spectral signal differed significantly from values obtained with colour TD and M-mode (p &lt; 0.001, in both cases). Conclusion: LV systolic myocardial measurements based on mean spectral TD frequencies are highly concordant with those provided by colour TD and M-mode. Hence, in order to maintain compatibility of the results, the use of this particular spectral TD procedure should be advocated in clinical praxis.']\n",

Methods: In this study, left ventricular longitudinal systolic displacement was quantified in 57 patients (31 women and 26 men, 50 +/- 16 years) using colour (colour TD) and spectral tissue Doppler (spectral TD) before and after temporal filtering (30 to 70 milliseconds in 20-millisecond steps) and changed offline gain saturation (0%, 50% and 100%), respectively.

Results: Whereas only minor differences occurred between the results of colour TD and anatomic M-mode measurements, spectral TD significantly overestimated the results obtained with both these methods. However, the limits of agreement between the results produced by all three studied methods were not clinically acceptable in any of the cases. The spectral TD displacement values increased along with increasing offline gain saturation whereas the effect of temporal filtering on colour Doppler measurements was insignificant. Conclusion: Measurements of LV myocardial longitudinal displacement employing spectral TD, colour TD or anatomic M-mode produce different results, thus discouraging interchangeable use of these modalities. Whereas the results of spectral TD measurements can be significantly altered by changing offline gain setting, the effect of temporal filtering on colour TD measurements is insignificant, a fact that increases clinical practicality of the latter method.']\n",

This elevated risk was found to be significantly associated with an increased frequency of dysplastic nevi (DN) among familial patients compared to sporadic patients. MC1R variation was found to be less frequent among acral lentiginous melanomas (ALM) and dependent on tumour localisation.

The incidence rate was 67, 41 and 47 cases per 100 person years for neck, shoulder and arm/hand symptoms, respectively. In the multivariable analyses, comfort of the computer work environment and gender were related to the incidence of symptoms in all body regions (RR = 1.5-1.9 for low comfort and 1.8-2.1 for females, respectively).

Materials and Methods: The size of 12 polyp phantoms was assessed in tandem colonoscopies carried out by 7 endoscopists differing in years of clinical endoscopical experience. The endoscopists measured, with (n=5) or without (n=2) the aid of open forceps, the largest diameter of 12 polyp phantoms. Measurements in two independent trials were compared with the gold standard-size assessed at The Department Of Production Engineering, The Royal Institute of Technology. Results: In tandem trials, 99.4% (167/168) of the measurements underscored the gold standard size. In the 1st trial, the size in all 84 measurements was underestimated by -40% (range -34% to -45%) and in the 2nd trial the size in 83 of the 84 measurements was underestimated by -34% (range -24% to -42%). Neither the age of the participant, nor the years of experience with clinical endoscopy improved the results obtained. The participants significantly underestimated larger devices (>= 20 mm) whereas the smallest \"polyps\" were also underestimated, but with a lower degree of inaccuracy. The absolute difference between the golden standard size and the mean of all measurements performed on each polyp in 167 out of 168 measurements followed a regular downward trend. The volume of the devices was one of the confounding factors in size assessment. When compared to the gold standard size, the larger the \"polyp\" size, the higher the degree of underestimation. This may be crucial considering that the risk for colorectal adenomas to shelter an invasive growth is 46%, for adenomas measuring >= 2 cm, a limit accepted as a guideline worldwide for the management of patients with large colorectal polyps. Conclusion: Considering the clinical implications of the results obtained, the possibility of developing a method that would allow the assessment of the true size of polyps in clinical colonoscopy, is being explored.']\n",

Policy measures that stimulate more effective use of the existing network, such as variable road pricing, are therefore becoming increasingly popular among policy makers and citizens. These measures are often aimed at changing the temporal distribution of traffic. Yet transportation models taking departure time choice into account are rare. This paper describes the implementation of an urban transportation application for Stockholm, which includes departure time choice, mode choice and time dependent network assignment. Through iterations between demand and supply the objective of the transportation model is to forecast effects of congestion charges, intelligent transport systems and infrastructure investments on departure time choice. The complexity of large-scale departure time choice modelling and dynamic traffic assignment is high, which results in very long run times. Therefore, research on how to increase model efficiency is needed. This paper describes choices made in the implementation for a more efficient model.']\n",

Impacts on traffic safety and emissions are calculated using standard Swedish CBA relationships.

A common measure of travel time reliability is standard deviation, and it has been shown that this is a theoretically sound measure under scheduling constraints, provided that the mean lateness factor is known. Hence, in applied cost-benefit analyses, one will need both the standard deviation and the mean lateness factor. These analyses would be particularly simple if the mean lateness were constant across time of day and for different routes chosen. A study was done to explore how the mean lateness varies and how its variations can be approximated. With the use of travel time measurements on individual links, it is shown how mean lateness varies considerably across time and space. It is shown that mean lateness exhibits a time-varying pattern depending on the characteristics of congestion on the link. It is also shown that the location of the link in the network is a significant determinant. The resulting model for mean lateness represents a considerable improvement over existing practice, where the mean lateness is implicitly assumed constant, yet a large portion of its variation remains unexplained. The model is useful for informing future research but is of less value for predicting the mean lateness in broad applied settings.']\n",

We propose aggregate supply-side (link redundancy, network scale, road density, population density) and demand-side (user travel time, traffic load) indicators and combine them in statistical regression models. Using the Swedish road network as a case study, we find that regional importance is largely determined by the network structure and the average traffic load in the region, whereas regional exposure is largely determined by the network structure and the average user travel time. Our findings show that the long-term vulnerability disparities stem from fundamental properties of the transport system and the population densities.

Focusing on the quantitative parts of a congestion pricing system with link tolls, the problem involves finding the number of toll links, the link toll locations and their corresponding toll level and schedule. In this paper, we develop and evaluate methods for finding the most efficient design for a congestion pricing scheme in a road network model with elastic demand. The design efficiency is measured by the net social surplus, which is computed as the difference between the social surplus and the collection costs (i.e. setup and operational costs) of the congestion pricing system. The problem of finding such a scheme is stated as a combinatorial bi-level optimization problem. At the upper level, we maximize the net social surplus and at the lower level we solve a user equilibrium problem with elastic demand, given the toll locations and toll levels, to simulate the user response. We modify a known heuristic procedure for finding the optimal locations and toll levels given a fixed number of tolls to locate, to find the optimal number of toll facilities as well. A new heuristic procedure, based on repeated solutions of a continuous approximation of the combinatorial problem is also presented. Numerical results for two small test networks are presented.

A sequential nucleation concept of oxides and MnS is proposed in relation to the growth morphology of MnS and graphite with respect to the mechanical properties of cast iron. The nucleation of new oxides and sulfides was analyzed using thermodynamics and compared to our experimental results. Graphite nucleation on substrates other than MnS, such as MoS2 oxides and (Mo,Cr)S, was experimentally analyzed along with the influence of the substrates on graphite nucleation and growth morphology.']\n",

This paper proposes flow regulation and has defined a regulation spectrum as a means for system-on-chip architects to control delay and backlog bounds. The regulation is performed per flow for its peak rate and burstiness. However, many flows may have conflicting regulation requirements due to interferences with each other. Based on the regulation spectrum, this paper optimizes the regulation parameters aiming for buffer optimization. Three timing-constrained buffer optimization problems are formulated, namely, buffer size minimization, buffer variance minimization, and multiobjective optimization, which has both buffer size and variance as minimization objectives. Minimizing buffer variance is also important because it affects the modularity of routers and network interfaces. A realistic case study exhibits 62.8% reduction of total buffers, 84.3% reduction of total latency, and 94.4% reduction on the sum of variances of buffers. Likewise, the experimental results demonstrate similar improvements in the case of synthetic traffic patterns. The optimization algorithm has low run-time complexity, enabling quick exploration of large design spaces.

It is the first time that rotation profiles in JET plasmas with LH waves have been measured in dedicated discharges.

An interesting feature is that the toroidal rotation profile appears to be hollow in many discharges at low plasma current, but a low current in itself does not seem to be a sufficient condition for finding such profiles. Fast ion transport and finite orbit width effects are mechanisms that could explain hollow rotation profiles. This possibility has been investigated by numerical simulations of the torque on the bulk plasma due to fast ICRF accelerated ions.

The simulations were carried out using the Monte Carlo guiding-centre orbit-following code ASCOT. The FIs were found very effective in ameliorating the detrimental effects of the toroidal ripple: the fast ion wall loads are reduced practically to their negligible axisymmetric level. The thermonuclear alpha particles overwhelmingly dominate the wall power flux. In scenario-4 practically all the power goes to the limiters, while in scenario-2 the load is fairly evenly divided between the divertor and the limiter, with hardly any power flux to other components in the first wall. This is opposite to earlier results, where hot spots were observed with 2D wall (Tobita et al 2003 Fusion Eng. Des. 65 561-8). In contrast, uncompensated ripple leads to unacceptable peak power fluxes of 0.5 MW m(-2) in scenario-2 and 1 MW m(-2) in scenario-4, with practically all power hitting the limiters and substantial flux arriving even at the unprotected first wall components. The local TBM structures were found to perturb the magnetic field structure globally and lead to increased wall loads.

      "[\"This study reports a novel method for the rapid detection and identification of the four recognized species in the pestivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family, i.e. classical swine fever virus (CSFV), border disease virus (BDV), bovine viral diarrhoea virus type 1 (BVDV1) and type 2 (BVDV2). The analysis of pestivirus PCR products was performed on microarrays by means of magnetic bead detection. The process utilizes an oligonucleotide array, onto which 5' biotinylated PCR products were hybridized, followed by visualization with streptavidin-coated magnetic particles by the naked eye, microscope or biochip reader. The assay was tested on a collection of pestiviruses that included all four species and allowed a specific and sensitive detection. Sensitivity was compared with other post-PCR detection methods, namely gel electrophoresis and suspension microarray. The results indicate that due to its high sensitivity, specificity and simple detection procedure, the magnetic bead assay provides a powerful tool for detection and identification of viral pathogens. Considering the simplicity of the assay, the protocols for hybridization and magnetic bead detection offer an emerging application for molecular diagnoses in virology that is amenable for use in a modestly equipped laboratory.\"]\n",

We developed a miniaturized stem cell screening chip that is easily accessible and provides means of rapidly studying thousands of individual stem/progenitor cell samples, using low reagent volumes. For example, screening of 700,000 substances would take less than two days, using this platform combined with a conventional bio-imaging system. The microwell chip has standard slide format and consists of 672 wells in total. Each well holds 500 nl, a volume small enough to drastically decrease reagent costs but large enough to allow utilization of standard laboratory equipment. Results presented here include weeklong culturing and differentiation assays of mouse embryonic stem cells, mouse adult neural stem cells, and human embryonic stem cells. The possibility to either maintain the cells as stem/progenitor cells or to study cell differentiation of stem/progenitor cells over time is demonstrated. Clonality is critical for stem cell research, and was accomplished in the microwell chips by isolation and clonal analysis of single mouse embryonic stem cells using flow cytometric cell-sorting. Protocols for practical handling of the microwell chips are presented, describing a rapid and user-friendly method for the simultaneous study of thousands of stem cell cultures in small microwells. This microwell chip has high potential for a wide range of applications, for example directed differentiation assays and screening of reprogramming factors, opening up considerable opportunities in the stem cell field.']\n",

Here we present a method for the genetic analysis of cells cultured on-chip by PCR and minisequencing, demonstrated using two human adherent cell lines: one wild type and one with a single-base mutation in the p53 gene. Five wild type or mutated cells were seeded per well (in a defined set of wells, each holding 500 nL of culture medium) in a 672-microwell chip. The cell chip was incubated overnight, or cultured for up to five days, depending on the desired colony size, after which the cells were lysed and subjected to PCR directly in the wells. PCR products were detected, in the wells, using a biotinylated primer and a fluorescently labelled primer, allowing the products to be captured on streptavidin-coated magnetic beads and detected by a fluorescence microscope. In addition, to enable genetic analysis by minisequencing, the double-stranded PCR products were denatured and the immobilized strands were kept in the wells by applying a magnetic field from the bottom of the wells while the wells were washed, a minisequencing reaction mixture was added, and after incubation in appropriate conditions the expected genotypes were detected in the investigated microwells, simultaneously, by an array scanner.

      "['Increasing awareness of the importance of cell heterogeneity in many biological and medical contexts is prompting increasing interest in systems that allow single-cell analysis rather than conventional bulk analysis (which provides average values for variables of interest from large numbers of cells). Recently, we presented a microwell chip for long-term, high-throughput single-cell analysis. The chip has proved to be useful for purposes such as screening individual cancer and stem cells for protein/gene markers. However, liquids in the wells can only be added or changed by manually rinsing the chip, or parts of it. This procedure has several well-known drawbacks - including risks of cross-contamination, large dead volumes and laboriousness - but there have been few previous attempts to integrate liquid rinsing/switching channels in \"ready-to-use\" systems for single-cell analysis. Here we present a microwell system designed (using flow simulations) for single-cell analysis with integrated microfluidic components (microchannels, magnetically driven micropumps and reservoirs) for supplying the cell culture wells with reagents, or rinsing, thus facilitating controlled, directed liquid handling. It can be used totally independently, since tubing is not essential. The practical utility of the integrated system has been demonstrated by culturing endothelial cells in the microwells, and successfully applying live-cell Calcein AM staining. Systems such as this combining high-density microwell chips with microfluidic components have great potential in numerous screening applications, such as exploring the important, but frequently undetected, heterogeneity in drug responses among individual cells.']\n",

      "['Two new methods for determining sorption coefficients in large rock samples have been developed. The methods use electromigration as a means to speed up the transport process, allowing for fast equilibration between rock sample and tracer solution. An electrical potential gradient acts as a driving force for transport in addition to the concentration gradient and forces the cations through the rock sample towards the cathode. The electrical potential gradient induces both electromigration and electroosmotic flow with a resulting solute transport that is large compared to diffusive fluxes. In one of the methods, the solute is driven through the sample and collected at the cutlet side. In the other, simpler method, the rock sample is equilibrated by circulating the solute through the sample. The equilibration of rock samples, up to 5 cm in length, with an aqueous solution has been accomplished within days to months. Experiments using cesium as a sorbing tracer yield results consistent with considerably more time demanding in-diffusion experiments.

Other parts of the food system contribute carbon dioxide emissions that emanate from the use of fossil fuels in transportation, processing, retailing, storage, and preparation. Food items differ substantially when GHG emissions are calculated from farm to table. A recent study of approximate to 20 items sold in Sweden showed a span of 0.4 to 30 kg CO2 equivalents/kg edible product. For protein-rich food, such as legumes, meat, fish, cheese, and eggs, the difference is a factor of 30 with the lowest emissions per kilogram for legumes, poultry, and eggs and the highest for beef, cheese, and pork. Large emissions for ruminants are explained mainly by methane emissions from enteric fermentation.

      "['Municipal solid waste (MSW) is not only a societal problem addressed with environmental impact, it is also a resource that can be used for energy supply. In Northern Europe combustion of MSW ( incineration with energy recovery) in combination with district heating systems is quite common. In Sweden, about 47% of the household waste is treated by incineration with energy recovery. Most incineration plants are CHP, summing up to 0.3% of the total electricity generation. MSW is to a high extent a renewable fuel, but plastic, rubber etc. can amount to 50% of the carbon content in the waste. Recycling of plastic is in general environmentally favourable in comparison to landfill disposal or incineration. However, some plastic types are not possible to recycle and some plastic is of such low quality that it is not suitable for recycling. This paper focuses on the non-renewable and non-recyclable plastic in MSW. A CO2 assessment has been made for non-recyclable plastic where incineration with energy recovery has been compared to landfill disposal. In the assessment, consideration has been taken of alternative fuel in the incinerator, emissions from waste treatment and avoided emissions from heat and power supply. For landfill disposal of plastic the emissions of CO2 amounts to 253 g kg(-1) plastic. For incineration, depending on different discrete choices, the results vary from -673 g kg(-1) to 4605 g kg(-1). Results indicate that for typical Swedish and European conditions, incineration of plastics has net emissions of greenhouse gases. These emissions are also in general higher for incineration than for landfill disposal. However in situations where plastics are incinerated with high efficiency and high electricity to heat ratios, and the heat and the electricity from incineration of plastics are replacing heat and electricity in non-combined heat and power plants based on fossil fuels, incineration of plastics can give a net negative contribution of greenhouse gases. The results suggest that efforts should be made to increase recycling of plastics, direct incineration of plastics in places where it can be combusted with high efficiency and high electricity-to-heat ratios where it is replacing fossil fuels, and reconsider the present policies of avoiding landfill disposal of plastics.']\n",

Besides that it is easy to turn it on and off and it is able to support present vibration in vehicles. A PEMFC's problem is the need of noble catalysts like platinum.

The electrospray is generated at the endpoint of the gap, where the spray point is formed by the very sharp intersection between the crystal planes of the &lt; 100 &gt; silicon chips. Sample solution is applied to the rear end of the gap from a capillary via a liquid bridge, and capillary forces ensure a spontaneous imbibition of the gap. The sample solution is confined to the gap by means of a hydrophobic treatment of the surfaces surrounding the gap, as well as the geometrical boundaries formed by the edges of the gap walls. The gap width could be adjusted between 1 and 25 Î¼m during electrospray experiments without suffering from any interruption of the electrospray process. Using a peptide sample solution, a shift toward higher charge states and increased signal-to-noise ratios was observed when the gap width was decreased.

The double bond functionality enables further reactions subsequent to polymerization. The monomer 2-methylene-1,3-dioxe-5-pene was synthesized and polymerized in bulk by free radical polymerization at different temperatures, to determine the structure of the products and propose a reaction mechanism. The reaction mechanism is dependent on the reaction temperature. At higher temperatures, ring-opening takes place to a great extent followed by a new cyclization process to form the stable five-membered cyclic ester 3-vinyl-1,4-butyrolactone as the main reaction product. Thereby, propagation is suppressed and only small amounts of other oligomeric products are formed. At lower temperatures, the cyclic ester formation is reduced and oligomeric products containing both ring-opened and ring-retained repeating units are produced at higher yield.']\n",

The complete amino acid sequence of HvXET6 was deduced from the nucleotide sequence of a near full-length cDNA, in combination with tryptic peptide mapping. An additional five to six isoforms or post-translationally modified XET enzymes were detected in crude seedling extracts of barley. The HvXET6 isoenzyme was expressed in Pichia pastoris, characterized and compared with the previously purified native HvXET5 isoform. Barley HvXET6 has a similar apparent molecular mass of 33-35 kDa to the previously purified HvXET5 isoenzyme, but the two isoenzymes differ in their isoelectric points, pH optima, kinetic properties and substrate specificities. The HvXET6 isoenzyme catalyses transfer reactions between xyloglucans and soluble cellulosic substrates, using oligo-xyloglucosides as acceptors, but at rates that are significantly different from those observed for HvXET5. No hydrolytic activity could be detected with either isoenzyme. Comparisons of the reaction rates using xyloglucan or hydroxyethyl cellulose as donors and a series of cellodextrins as acceptors indicated that the acceptor site of HvXET can accommodate five glucosyl residues. Molecular modelling supported this conclusion and further confirmed the ability of the enzyme's active site to accommodate xyloglucan and cellulosic substrates. The two HvXETs followed a ping-pong (Bi, Bi) rather than a sequential reaction mechanism.\"]\n",

With a redshift of z = 1.822, this burst is among the most luminous detected by Fermi. Time-resolved spectral analysis reveals a significant power-law component in the LAT data that is distinct from the usual Band model emission that is seen in the sub-MeV energy range. This power-law component appears to extrapolate from the GeV range to the lowest energies and is more intense than the Band component, both below similar to 50 keV and above 100 MeV. The Band component undergoes substantial spectral evolution over the entire course of the burst, while the photon index of the power-law component remains constant for most of the prompt phase, then hardens significantly toward the end. After the prompt phase, power-law emission persists in the LAT data as late as 1 ks post-trigger, with its flux declining as t(-1.5). The LAT detected a photon with the highest energy so far measured from a GRB, 33.4(-3.5)(+ 2.7) GeV. This event arrived 82 s after the GBM trigger and similar to 50 s after the prompt phase emission had ended in the GBM band.

This class of objects is thought to have relatively small black hole mass and to accrete at a high Eddington ratio.

Both radio and gamma-ray emissions (observed over five months) are strongly variable. The simultaneous optical and X-ray data from Swift show a blue continuum attributed to the accretion disk and a hard X-ray spectrum attributed to the jet.

The influence of the varying temperature on the development and jet growth is studied as well as turbulence and scalar statistics. The varying density affects the turbulence structures of the jets. Smaller turbulence scales are present in the warm jet than in the isothermal and cold jet and consequently the scale separation between the inner and outer shear layer is larger. In addition, a cold jet in a warm coflow at a higher inlet Reynolds number was also simulated. Although the domain length is somewhat limited, the growth rate and the turbulence statistics indicate approximate self-similarity in the fully turbulent region. The use of van Driest scaling leads to a collapse of all mean velocity profiles in the near-wall region. Taking into account the varying density by using semilocal scaling of turbulent stresses and fluctuations does not completely eliminate differences, indicating the influence of mean density variations on normalized turbulence statistics.

The available Reynolds stress budgets provide valuable references for future development of turbulence models.\"]\n",

The layer has to be both thick enough to protect the information and even enough for the information to be read through it optically. Furthermore, it is preferred not to cover the hole in the center of the disk. Spin coating is a candidate method for the production of these layers in a rapid reproduction process. When dispensing is performed off-center (in order not to cover the hole), a new complication appears, namely the formation of a slope toward the inner rim of the liquid film. Here, fundamental limitations for achieving even films in this system and ways to overcome the difficulties by manipulation of the process are studied. A mathematical model for this particular case of spin coating is obtained and validated by comparison with experiments made in industrial equipment aiming at producing BDs. The model agrees well with the experimental data. The model is then used to show that cover layers that fulfil the Blu-Ray specification are very difficult to produce with the spin-coating technique. Manipulation by inline curing and surface shear is added to the model and the results show that it is considerably easier to meet the BD specification when utilizing the manipulation.']\n",

Co was found to be incorporated into the Fe2O3 phase after calcination, at least for the iron-rich samples, while no evidence of Fe incorporated into Co3O4 was found. Upon reduction, most probably FeCo alloys were formed in the iron-rich bimetallic samples. The degree of reduction of the catalysts showed a non-linear behavior with respect to the Fe:Co ratio, but it is obvious that Co increases the reducibility of Fe. Alloying Co with small/moderate amounts of Fe improved the FT activity compared to the 100% Co catalyst at low conversion levels. Alloying Fe with small/moderate amounts of Co lowered the FT activity, but increased the relative water-gas-shift (WGS) activity compared to the 100% Fe catalyst. However, the overall WGS activity was very low for all catalysts, even with external water addition to the feed, resulting in low FT productivities (per gram catalyst) due to the low partial pressure of H-2. A higher Fe:Co ratio in the bimetallic catalyst generally resulted in higher relative WGS activity, but did not lower the H-2/CO usage ratio to the desired value of 1.0. For the Fe-containing catalysts, the space-time yield of hydrocarbons (HCs) decreased with increasing partial pressure of water or reduced space velocity, indicating an inhibition of water on the FT activity, most often resulting in low FT productivity under the conditions with highest relative WGS activity (usage ratios closest to the inlet H-2/CO ratio). Moreover, the co-impregnation technique resulted in a surface enrichment of Fe, at least for the Co-rich samples, covering the Co sites. For the bimetallic catalysts, both FT and WGS activities rapidly declined at high partial pressure of water due to deactivation by oxidation and sintering. However, the results indicate that WGS and FT proceeded over sites of different nature in the bimetallic catalysts.The bimetallic catalysts showed essentially no synergy effects with respect to HC selectivities and olefin/paraffin ratios, which partly can be explained by the use of a sub-stoichiometric H-2/CO ratio as feed. The higher the Fe content, the lower were the C5+ selectivity and C-3 olefin/paraffin ratio. Water addition increased the C5+ selectivity and C-3 Olefin/paraffin ratio and reduced the CH4 selectivity.']\n",

      "[\"In this investigation, single coal particles (pellets) were combusted in highly preheated oxidants (8731273 K) with oxygen concentrations ranging from 0% to 100%, using a small scale' batch reactor. In base of the experimental results, the influence of oxygen concentration and oxidizer temperature on total mass conversion, the release of fuel nitrogen and the fraction of fuel nitrogen that is oxidized to NOx, is discussed. For oxygen concentration 5-21%, the rate of the thermochemical conversion was shown to be almost independent oxygen concentration when oxidant temperatures of 1073-1273 K were used. The opposite was true for an oxidant temperature of 873 K. Thus there appears to be an oxidant temperature above which devolatilisation is controlled by convective heat transfer rather than reaction. Further it was shown that the release of fuel nitrogen was promoted by an increased oxygen concentration (from 5% to 21% at 1273 K) and an increase of oxidant temperature (from 1073 K to 1273 K at 21% oxygen). An estimate of the devolatilisation of nitrogen from the measured pellet temperature indicated that the devolatilisation of nitrogen is significantly delayed with respect to other components. In fact, during the very initial part of the thermochemical conversion, most released nitrogen appeared to follow the route via char rather than via devolatilisation. Favorable conditions for No reduction thanks to a prompt devolatilisation contemporarily to a release of fuel nitrogen via the char route was believed to be one of the explanation for the evidenced low ratios between NOx emissions and fuel nitrogen released, particularly in the beginning of the experiment. The fact that the amount of released fuel nitrogen that is oxidized to NOx was shown to decrease with increasing oxidant temperatures from 1073 K to 1273 K supports this interpretation, though a higher temperature of the oxidant creates higher devolatilisation rates.\"]\n",

In order to choose the best management scenario, knowledge is needed on the potential environmental impact that may be expected, including not only local, but also regional and global impact. In this study. A life cycle assessment (LCA) based approach Was Outlined for environmental assessment of incinerator residue utilisation, in which leaching of trace elements as well as other emissions to air and water and the use of resources were regarded as constituting the potential environmental impact from the system studied. Case Studies were performed for two selected ash types, bottom ash from municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) and wood fly ash. The MSWI bottom ash was assumed to be suitable for road construction or as drainage material in landfill, whereas the wood fly ash Was assumed to be suitable for road construction or as a nutrient resource to be recycled oil forest land after biofuel harvesting. Different types of potential environmental impact predominated in the activities of the system and the use of natural resources and the trace element leaching were identified as being relatively important for the scenarios compared. The scenarios differed in use of resources and energy, whereas there is a potential for trace element leaching regardless of how the material is managed. Utilising MSWI bottom ash in road construction and recycling of wood ash on forest land saved more natural resources and energy than when these materials were managed according to the other scenarios investigated, including dumping in landfill.']\n",

A recent REACH guidance document includes recommended default assessment factors that cover subacute-subchronic, subchronic-chronic, and subacute-chronic extrapolations. The recommended assessment factors are smaller than in most previous proposals, since they are calibrated to achieve central estimates (50th percentile of the target distribution) rather than a higher percentile such as the 95th, as has been more common. These assessment factors are nevertheless presented as representing a \"widely agreed level of conservatism\", a statement that may lead to misunderstandings of what is achieved by using them in a risk assessment. Assessment factors have been based on evidence from animal studies with different designs, in particular with focus on different endpoints. Our re-analysis of experimental data shows that using mortality as an endpoint leads to smaller assessment factors than if the factors are derived from corresponding ratios for non-lethal toxicity.']\n",

A significant increase in resistivity in the vadose zone with increasing distance from the road was shown in both sand and glacial till areas during the whole year. By measuring temporal variations in a less affected environment further from the road, a distinction could be made between more natural variations and variations due to de-icing salt and melting of roadside snowbanks. The highest resistivities occurred in October-November and the lowest in January-March, while the more natural resistivities showed an opposing temporal variation. The difference was up to 35% on a log-scale in the sand area during the latter period. Hence, the time-lapse resistivity measurements clearly showed a strong influence of de-icing salt on roadside soils and groundwater during winter and spring. The measurement system and the analysis methods proved useful for monitoring both the spatial and seasonal variation in resistivity.']\n",

This state of the art paper for the 21st IAVSD Symposium in Stockholm in August 2009 surveys the current applications for rail vehicle dynamic modelling. The process of reducing a complex mechanical system to a mathematical representation is invariably subject to compromise and open to individual interpretation. The level of detail and choice of idealisation of suspension components will depend on the application, and in the real world it also depends on the availability of information about the system. This paper discusses appropriate modelling choices for different applications, and comments on best practice for the idealisation of suspension components, wheel/rail contact conditions and modelling inputs such as track geometry.

The difference in the city shape results in significant difference in the local mean age of air. In the round city of one narrow street, two inflows through street openings converge close to the city centre and exits through the street roof, so the air close to the city centre is relatively old and the air exchange efficiency is low (30%).

We propose a new model for underground ventilation. The main components of the system dynamics are described with time-delays, transmission errors, energy losses and concentration profiles. Two different model-based control approaches, which can embody the complex dynamics of the system, are proposed. The first one resorts to a nonlinear model predictive control strategy (receding horizon) and aims to energy minimization, thanks to a continuous operation of the fans. The second one, based on a hybrid description of the model and fans operation, provides automatic verification of the wireless control thanks to abstraction techniques. These control strategies are compared with simulations, in terms of regulation efficiency, energy consumption and the need for computational capabilities. The industrial case description and control strategies open new vistas for the development of global system approaches that allow for the optimization of energy consumption of complex large-scale systems.']\n",

Whereas particularly Swedish operators prefer AON, this may not be the case for operators in other countries.

Due to the increasing importance of reliable access to the network services, connection availability is becoming one of the most crucial issues for access networks. which should be reflected in the network owner's architecture decision. In many cases protection against failures is realized by adding backup resources.

In this way, users which  miss the original transmission have more chances to receive the  information correctly.

Operators are challenged by the fact that revenues from mobile roadband are limited, just a few per cent of ARPU, and thus not compensating for declining voice revenues, creating a so called \"revenue gap\". Concurrently, mobile broadband dominates the traffic, set to grow strongly. In this paper we analyze the potential of different strategies for operators to reduce or bridge the revenue gap. The main options are to reduce network costs, to increase access prices and to exploit new revenue streams.

A sensitivity analysis illustrates the impact on total revenues if access prices are increased, whether new types of services generate additional revenues, and if it fills the revenue gap. Our conclusion is that the different technical options to reduce the revenue gap can be linked to business strategies that include cooperation with both other operators as well as with non-telecom actors.

To meet the redundancy requirements of telecom signaling traffic, SCTP includes a failover mechanism that enables rerouting of traffic from an unreachable network path to a backup path. However, the recommendations provided by IETF on how to configure the SCTP failover mechanism to meet telecom signaling requirements are kept quite general and leave much of the tuning to the telecom equipment vendor and/or operator.

The main contribution of this paper is that it gives a coherent treatment of how to configure the SCTP failover mechanism for carrier-grade telephony signaling, and provides practically usable configuration recommendations.

Deliberate physical-layer attacks, such as high-powered jamming, can seriously degrade network performance and must be dealt with efficiently. While most approaches are focused on the developing fast detection and reaction mechanisms triggered in case of an attack, we propose a novel approach to help deal with these issues in the network planning and provisioning process as a prevention mechanism. Namely, we propose to route lightpaths in such a way as to minimize the potential damage caused by various physical-layer attacks. We present a new objective criterion for the routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) problem, which we call the maximum Lightpath Attack Radius (maxLAR), and formulate the routing subproblem as an integer linear program (ILP). We test it on small networks to get an insight into its complexity and compare it to a formulation that minimizes congestion. Results indicate that our formulation achieves significantly better results for the maxLAR while obtaining near-optimal or optimal congestion in all cases. For larger networks, we propose a tabu search algorithm for attack-aware lightpath routing, in combination with an existing graph-coloring algorithm for wavelength assignment. Testing and comparing with existing approaches from literature indicate its superiority with respect to the maxLAR and average lightpath load, albeit at the expense of somewhat higher congestion. However, this is justified with the obtained improvement in network security.']\n",

However, in a transparent WDM network the optical signal transmitted from a source to a destination node might be degraded due to physical layer impairments induced by transmission through optical fibers and components. Several Impairment Constraint Based Routing (ICBR) algorithms have been proposed to consider physical layer impairments during the connection-provisioning phase in order to prevent selecting a lightpath with poor signal quality. However, these algorithms support only a single quality of transmission threshold for all connection requests, while next generation networks and the future Internet are expected to support a variety of services with potentially disparate QoS requirements. In this paper, we propose the use of bit error rate (BER) as a differentiation of service parameter for connection requests in optical WDM networks. This is achieved through the use of ICBR, whereby various BER thresholds are set depending on the QoS requirements for accepting/blocking the connection requests during the connection-provisioning phase. The evaluation results reveal that significant network performance improvement in terms of connection blocking can be achieved, compared to non-differentiated conventional routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) and ICBR algorithms.']\n",

Although state of the art reliability mechanisms are very efficient in guaranteeing high availability, they do not consider the impact of the protection resources on the network's energy consumption. Dedicated (1:1) path protection (DPP) is a well-known mechanism that provides one extra link-disjoint path for the protection of a connection request. This secondary path is reserved and maintained in an active mode even though it is not utilized most of the time. This means that in-line optical amplifiers and switching nodes/ports are always consuming power even when they are not used to reroute any primary traffic. Moreover secondary paths are on average longer than their respective primary paths. These observations motivated us to investigate the energy savings, when all unused protection resources can be switched into a low-power, stand-by state (or sleep mode) during normal network operation and can be activated upon a failure. It is shown that significant reduction of power consumption (up to 25%) can be achieved by putting protection resources into sleep mode. Moreover, in order to enhance this energy saving figure, this paper proposes and evaluates different energy-efficient algorithms, specifically tailored around the sleep mode option, to dynamically provision 1:1 dedicated path protected connection. The trade-off between energy saving and blocking probability is discussed and an efficient mechanism to overcome this drawback is devised. Our results reveal that a 34% reduction of energy consumption can be obtained with a negligible impact on the network's blocking performance.\"]\n",

Although natural reserves are often seen as preserving 'higher valued' rather than 'lower valued' nature, it is more adequate to describe them as outcomes of selective social articulation processes. This is illustrated in the Stockholm National Urban Park. Despite strong exploitation pressure, a diverse urban movement of civil society organizations has managed to provide narratives able to explain and legitimize the need for protection-a 'protective story'. On the basis of qualitative data and building on theories of value articulation, social movements, and actor-networks, we show how activists, by interlacing artefacts and discourses from cultural history and conservation biology, managed to simultaneously link spatially separated green areas previously seen as disconnected, while also articulating the interrelatedness between the cultural and the natural history of the area. This connective practice constructed holistic values articulating a unified park, which heavily influenced the official framing of the park's values and which now help to explain the success of the movement. In contrast to historically top-down-led designation of natural reserves, we argue that the involvement of civil society in protecting nature (and culture) is on the rise. This nonetheless begs the question of who can participate in these value-creating processes, and we also strive to uncover constraining and facilitating factors for popular participation.

Like the theatre it is a space open for many kinds of drama, verbal re-enactments of events and forced resolutions of human conflicts. There are often strong emotions at play in the courtroom: desire and love, jealousy and anger, but also sadness and remorse, fear and suffering. These emotions are controlled and tempered by the physical design of the courtroom, by legal procedure and the rule-bound rationality of law, but also by the serious attitude of the judge(s) and lay judges. Although in legal proceedings the parties are restrained from giving voice to emotions, in reality feelings and affects show through: in glances, timber of voice, flushes, crying, laughter and smell of sweat. The expressions of emotion and affect may be involuntary or staged, but in either case they are very much part of what is said and done in the courtroom. However, in the legal representation of court proceedings in the transcripts and the rulings these human emotions and affects become invisible, the emotions have been filtered away or have sunk to the bottom of legal space. In my essay I explore the peculiar emotive social space constructed and enacted in the courtroom, in particular the ambiguous attitude towards human emotions in law: on the one hand as disturbing and dangerous, and on the other as the true basis of human character and social conflict. The study is based on an ethnographic study of the lower level court in Stockholm (Stockholms tingsreitt). The study is part of a larger study on \"Legal Spaces.

      "['Mammography is currently one of the most common x-\\x90ray imaging examinations. More than 100 million women worldwide are screened every year and early detection of breast cancer through mammography has proven to be a key to significantly reduced mortality. The requirement on spatial resolution as well as contrast resolution is very high in order to detect and diagnose the cancer. Moreover, because of the large number of women going through this procedure and the fact that more than 99 % are healthy, it also becomes very important to minimize the radiation dose. Photon counting may be one way to meet the demands and mammography is the first modality in x-\\x90ray imaging to implement photon counting detectors. FDA approval is still pending but they are currently in routine clinical use in more than 15 countries. The photon counting enables a discrimination of all electronic noise and a more optimum use of the information in each x-\\x90ray. The absence of electronic noise is particularly important in low dose applications, in for example tomosynthesis a number of exposures from different angles are required and since the dose in each projection is just a fraction of the total dose for a mammogram the sensitivity to electronic noise will increase. Using the spectral information for each x-\\x90ray it is in principle possible to deduce the elemental composition of an object in the breast. This could for example be used to enhance microcalcifications relative to soft tissue and differentiate water from fat in cysts. Recently contrast mammography has attracted significant attention. In this application Iodine is used as a contrast media to visualize the vascular structure. As in breast MRI the cancer stand out because of the leaky vessels resulting from its angiogenesis. A photon counting detector gives a unique opportunity to image the Iodine through spectral imaging by adjusting one of the thresholds to its K-\\x90edge. Challenges for photon counting in mammography are high rates of x-\\x90rays, both to generate the required flux at the source and to handle the rates at the detector without pile-\\x90up. Even more difficult to handle are the charge sharing between detector pixels which, if not corrected for, will compromise the energy information. The current status of photon counting detectors in mammography will be described together with strategies to overcome the pit-\\x90falls. Also future possibilities with spectral imaging in mammography will be investigated and examples from ongoing clinical trials will be given. Learning Objectives: 1. Status of photon counting detectors in mammography 2. Pit-\\x90falls and opportunities with photon counting detectors for mammography 3.

The response calculation includes quenching effects due to low-energy recoil electrons and the position dependence of the light collection efficiency in a 20 cm long scintillator rod. The broadening of the pulse-height spectrum, presumably caused by light transportation processes inside the scintillator, as well as the generation and multiplication of photoelectrons in the photomultiplier tube, were studied experimentally and have also been taken into account. A Monte Carlo simulation based on the Geant4 toolkit was used to model photon interactions in the scintillators. When using the polarized Compton/Rayleigh scattering processes previously corrected by the authors, scintillator spectra and angular distributions of scattered polarized photons could clearly be reproduced, in agreement with the results obtained at a synchrotron beam test conducted at the KEK Photon Factory. Our simulation successfully reproduces the modulation factor, defined as the ratio of the amplitude to the mean of the distribution of the azimuthal scattering angles, within similar to 5% (relative).

Measurements from the European Incoherent Scatter Radar (EISCAT) have been combined with the optical measurements, and incorporated into an ionospheric model to obtain height profiles of electron density and emission rates of the N(2)1P bands. The radar data provide essential verification that the energy flux used in the model is correct.

The balance equations for production and loss of the populations of all levels in each state are solved in order to find the cascade contributions. Several sets of cross sections have been considered, and selected cross sections have been used to construct \"emission\" cross sections for the observed bands. The resulting brightnesses are compared with those measured by ASK. The importance of specific contributions from cascading is found, with more than 50% of the total brightness resulting from cascading.

The choice of filters for the imagers is discussed, with particular emphasis on the choice of the atomic oxygen line at 777.4 nm as one of the three emissions measured.

In the event chosen, measurements were made from mainland Norway, near Tromso, (69.6 N, 19.2 E). The peak energies of precipitation were between 1-15 keV. In a narrow curling arc, it was found that the arc filaments resulted from energies in excess of 10 keV and fluxes of approximately 7mW/m(2). These filaments of the order of 100 m in width were embedded in a region of lower energies (about 5-10 keV) and fluxes of about 3 mW/m(2).

Users in such environments would instead like to be continuously informed about services relevant to them. Implicit discovery requests triggered by changes in the context are therefore prevalent. This paper proposes a proactiveservice discovery approach for pervasive environments addressing these implicit requests. Services and user preferences are described by a formal context modelcalled Hyperspace Analogue to Context, which effectively captures the dynamics of context and the relationship between services and context. Based on the model, we propose a set of algorithms that can continuously present the most relevant services to the user in response to changes of context, services or user preferences. Numeric coding methods are applied to improve the algorithms-™ performance. The algorithms are grounded in a context-driven service discovery system that automatically reacts to changes in the environment.

This approach has the advantage that large digital screening databases that are becoming available can be used for training. DBT is currently not used for screening which makes it hard to obtain sufficient data for training. Methods: The proposed CAD system is applied to reconstructed DBT volumes and consists of two stages. In the first stage, an existing 2D CAD system is applied to slabs composed of multiple DBT slices, after processing the slabs to a representation similar to that of the FFDM training data. In the second stage, the authors group detections obtained in the slabs that detect the same object and determine the 3D location of the grouped findings using one of three different approaches, including one that uses a set of features extracted from the DBT slabs. Experiments were conducted to determine performance of the CAD system, the optimal slab thickness for this approach and the best method to establish the 3D location. Experiments were performed using a database of 192 patients (752 DBT volumes). In 49 patients, one or more malignancies were present which were described as a mass, architectural distortion, or asymmetry.

Early detection of cancer usually results in less extensive treatment and better outcome for the patient. Millimeter wave silicon micromachined waveguide probe is foreseen as an aid for skin diagnosis, which is currently based on visual inspection followed by biopsy, in cases where the macroscopical picture raises suspicion of malignancy. Aims: Demonstration of the discrimination potential of tissues of different water content using a novel micromachined silicon waveguide probe. Secondarily, the silicon probe miniaturization till an inspection area of 600 Á— 200 Î¼m2, representing a drastic reduction by 96.3% of the probing area, in comparison with a conventional WR-10 waveguide. The high planar resolution is required for histology and early-state skin-cancer detection. Material and methods: To evaluate the probe three phantoms with different water contents, i.e. 50%, 75% and 95%, mimicking dielectric properties of human skin were characterized in the frequency range of 95-105 GHz. The complex permittivity values of the skin are obtained from the variation in frequency and amplitude of the reflection coefficient (S11), measured with a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA), by comparison with finite elements simulations of the measurement set-up, using the commercially available software, HFSS. The expected frequency variation is calculated with HFSS and is based on extrapolated complex permittivities, using one relaxation Debye model from permittivity measurements obtained using the Agilent probe. Results: Millimeter wave reflection measurements were performed using the probe in the frequency range of 95-105 GHz with three phantoms materials and air. Intermediate measurement results are in good agreement with HFSS simulations, based on the extrapolated complex permittivity. The resonance frequency lowers, from the idle situation when it is probing air, respectively by 0.7, 1.2 and 4.26 GHz when a phantom material of 50%, 75% and 95% water content is measured. Discussion: The results of the measurements in our laboratory set-up with three different phantoms indicate that the probe may be able to discriminate between normal and pathological skin tissue, improving the spatial resolution in histology and on skin measurements, due to the highly reduced area of probing. Conclusion: The probe has the potential to discriminate between normal and pathological skin tissue. Further, improved information, compared to the optical histological inspection can be obtained, i.e. the complex permittivity characterization is obtained with a high resolution, due to the highly reduced measurement area of the probe tip.']\n",

The impact on model predictions of physical effects of importance in the SPP mission is also considered by comparing results obtained with and without these effects. Simulation results are presented and compared with increasing levels of complexity in the physics of interaction between solar environment and the SPP spacecraft. The comparisons focus particularly on spacecraft floating potentials, contributions to the currents collected and emitted by the spacecraft, and on the potential and density spatial profiles near the satellite. The physical effects considered include spacecraft charging, photoelectron and secondary electron emission, and the presence of a background magnetic field. Model predictions obtained with our different computational approaches are found to be in agreement within 2% when the same physical processes are taken into account and treated similarly. The comparisons thus indicate that, with the correct description of important physical effects, our simulation models should have the required skill to predict details of satellite-plasma interaction physics under relevant conditions, with a good level of confidence. Our models concur in predicting a negative floating potential V-fl similar to -10V for SPP at perihelion. They also predict a \"saturated emission regime\" whereby most emitted photo-and secondary electron will be reflected by a potential barrier near the surface, back to the spacecraft where they will be recollected.']\n",

Using this new formulation, the transmission network service provider can measure the impact of additional transmission capacity on nodal (or regional) market prices. This allows the transmission network service provider to implicitly model the competitive effect of additional transmission capacity in its investment decisions. A metric termed L-Shape Area is developed to measure the deviation of market prices from the competitive ones. The alternative formulation is a bi-level optimisation problem. To solve this problem, the inner optimisation problem is replaced by its equivalent Karush-KuhnTucker optimality conditions. The result is a non-linear programming problem that is solved using a gradient search method. IEEE 14-bus example system is used for numerical studies.']\n",

      "[\"Additional transmission capacity can improve the performance of the electricity market from two perspectives: firstly, efficiency benefit in terms of improving the social welfare of the electricity industry; and, secondly, competition benefit that leads to increasing competition among generating companies. This paper introduces an algorithm to model both the efficiency and competition benefits of additional transmission capacity in the process of transmission augmentation. The economic mathematical model is developed based on game theory in applied mathematics and the concept of social welfare in microeconomics. Transmission network service providers, generating companies and market management companies are placed in different stages of the developed model. The multiple Nash equilibria problem is tackled through the introduced concept of worst-Nash equilibrium. A numerical algorithm is designed to solve the developed model. The Garver's and IEEE 14-bus example systems are carefully modified to suit the purpose of this study; the former is used for conceptual evaluation of the algorithm, and the latter for testing the developed numerical solution.

Conventional indicators of market power fail to capture key aspects of the exercise of market power in wholesale electricity markets. On the other hand, full-scale computation of Nash equilibria has historically been time consuming, non-transparent, and typically results in multiple Nash equilibria. In this paper we propose two methodological advances: an efficient approach to computing extremal-Nash equilibria in a wholesale power market with market power and the application of this approach in the assessment of wholesale market mergers. The extremal-Nash equilibria are those equilibria which have the highest or the lowest social cost to the society. The resulting formulation is a Mixed Integer Linear Program which efficiently finds the full set of extremal-Nash equilibria. The continuum of these extremal-Nash equilibria over a range of demand conditions describes the upper and lower envelopes of the Equilibria Band. To illustrate the advantages of the proposed approach, two case studies are explored, involving the New South Wales region of the Australian National Electricity Market, on the one hand, and the IEEE 14-Bus Test System, on the other.']\n",

In conventional UC problems, power schedules are used to represent the staircase energy schedule. However, the realizability of this schedule cannot be guaranteed due to the violation of ramping limits, and hence conventional UC formulations do not manage the flexibility of generating units efficiently. This paper provides a UC-based MC formulation, drawing a clear distinction between power and energy. Demand and generation are modeled as hourly piecewise-linear functions representing their instantaneous power trajectories. The schedule of generating unit output is no longer a staircase function, but a smoother function that respects all ramp constraints. The formulation represents in detail the operating reserves (online and offline), their time deployment limits (e.g., 15 min), their potential substitution, and their limits according to the actual ramp schedule. Startup and shutdown power trajectories are also modeled, and thus a more efficient energy and reserves schedule is obtained.

The intensity-dependent self-focusing formation and multifocus structures of the infrared (IR) laser beam were directly observed in a three-photon active fluorescent dye solution cell, in which a high contrast image of the spatial structure of the self-focusing beam can be obtained due to the cubic dependence of the fluorescence intensity on the local IR laser intensity. By combining this dye solution cell with another cell filled with various transparent organic liquids, the contributions of these tested liquids to the observed self-focusing effect are elucidated. The numerical simulations for this type of self-focusing behavior are presented, based on the assumption that the major contribution to the observed self-focusing is the nonlinear refractive-index change of the solvent due to electronic-cloud distortion.

The interface can be classified as a conformal dry sliding contact. During braking both brake pad and rotor surfaces are worn, affecting the useful life of the brake as well as its behavior. This paper discusses how wear of the pad-to-rotor interface can be predicted using general purpose finite element analysis software. A three-dimensional finite element model of the brake pad and the rotor is developed to calculate the pressure distribution in the pad-to-rotor contact. A wear simulation procedure based on a generalized form of Archard's wear law and explicit Euler integration is used to simulate the wear of the brake pad under steady-state drag conditions.\"]\n",

      "['In order to develop more durable wheel materials to cope with the new specifications being imposed on wheel wear, a greater understanding of the wear mechanisms and transitions occurring in wheel steels is needed, particularly at higher load and slip conditions. The aim of this work was to draw together current understanding of the wear mechanisms, regimes, and transitions (particularly with R8T wheel material) and new tests on R7T wheel material; to identify gaps in the knowledge; and to develop new tools for assessing wear of wheel materials, such as wear maps, that can be used to improve wear prediction. Wear assessment of wheel materials, as well as wear rates, regimes, and transitions, is discussed. Twin disc wear testing, used extensively for studying wear of wheel and rail materials, has indicated that three wear regimes exist for wheel materials: mild, severe, and catastrophic. These have been classified in terms of wear rate and features. Wear rates are seen to increase steadily initially and then level off, before increasing rapidly as the severity of the contact conditions is increased. Analysis of the contact conditions in terms of friction and slip has indicated that the levelling off of the wear rate observed at the first wear transition is caused by the change from partial slip to full slip conditions at the disc interface. Temperature calculations for the contact showed that the large increase in wear rates seen at the second wear transition may result from a thermally induced reduction in yield strength and other material properties. Comparisons made between discs and actual wheels have provided some support for the theories relating to the transitions observed. Wear maps have been produced using the test results to study how individual contact parameters such as load and sliding speed influence wear rates and transitions. The maps are also correlated to expected wheel-rail contact conditions. This improved understanding of wheel wear mechanisms and transitions will help in the aim of eventually attaining a wear modelling methodology reliant on material properties rather than on wear constants derived from testing.']\n",

Astroglial cells possess the water channel aquaporin 4 (AQP4). Recent studies from our laboratory have shown that glutamate, acting on group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), increases the permeability of astrocyte AQP4, which, in situations of hypoxia-ischemia, will increase astrocyte water uptake. Here we report that erythropoietin (EPO), which in recent years has emerged as a potent neuro-protective agent, antagonizes the effect of a group I mGluR agonist on astrocyte water permeability. Activation of group I mGluRs triggers fast and highly regular intracellular calcium oscillations and we show that EPO interferes with this signaling event by altering the frequency of the oscillations. These effects of EPO are immediate, in contrast to the neuroprotective effects of EPO that are known to depend upon gene activation. Our findings indicate that EPO may directly reduce the risk of astrocyte swelling in stroke and other brain insults. In support of this conclusion we found that EPO reduced the neurological symptoms in a mouse model of primary brain edema known to depend upon AQP4 water transport.']\n",

Experiments were performed on adult skeletal muscle cells of wild-type (WT) and obese, insulin-resistant ob/ob mice. Application of the diacylglycerol analog 1-oleyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG) induced a nonselective cation current, which was inhibited by the addition of anti-TRPC3 antibody in the patch pipette and smaller in ob/ob than in WT cells. Knockdown of TRPC3, using a novel technique based on small interfering RNA (siRNA) coupled to functionalized carbon nanotubes, resulted in pronounced (similar to 70%) decreases in OAG-induced Ca2+ influx and insulin-mediated glucose uptake. TRPC3 and the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) coimmunoprecipitated, and immunofluorescence staining showed that they were colocalized in the proximity of the transverse tubular system, which is the predominant site of insulin-mediated glucose transport in skeletal muscle.

We investigated possible adaptive aspects of such cross-generation transmissions, and hypothesized that chronic unpredictable food access would cause chickens to show a more conservative feeding strategy and to be more dominant, and that these adaptations would be transmitted to the offspring. Methodology/Principal Findings: Parents were raised in an unpredictable (UL) or in predictable diurnal light rhythm (PL, 12:12 h light: dark). In a foraging test, UL birds pecked more at freely available, rather than at hidden and more attractive food, compared to birds from the PL group. Female offspring of UL birds, raised in predictable light conditions without parental contact, showed a similar foraging behavior, differing from offspring of PL birds. Furthermore, adult offspring of UL birds performed more food pecks in a dominance test, showed a higher preference for high energy food, survived better, and were heavier than offspring of PL parents. Using cDNA microarrays, we found that the differential brain gene expression caused by the challenge was mirrored in the offspring. In particular, several immunoglobulin genes seemed to be affected similarly in both UL parents and their offspring. Estradiol levels were significantly higher in egg yolk from UL birds, suggesting one possible mechanism for these effects.

To this day, it affects world agriculture by causing the most destructive disease of potato, the fourth largest food crop and a critical alternative to the major cereal crops for feeding the world's population(1).

Comparison with two other Phytophthora genomes showed rapid turnover and extensive expansion of specific families of secreted disease effector proteins, including many genes that are induced during infection or are predicted to have activities that alter host physiology.

This article presents the design and synthesis of a HER2-targeting affibody molecule with improved stability and tumor targeting capacity and with potential use as an imaging agent. The 58 aa three-helix bundle protein was assembled using solid-phase peptide synthesis, and a chemoselective ligation strategy was used to establish an intramolecular thioether bond between the side chain thiol group of a cysteine residue, positioned in the loop between helices I and II, and a chloroacetyl group on the side chain amino group of the C-terminal lysine residue. The tethered protein offered an increased thermal stability, with a melting temperature of 64 degrees C, compared to 54 degrees C for the linear control. The ligation did not have a major influence on the HER2 binding affinity, which was 320 and 380 pM for the crosslinked and linear molecules, respectively. Biodistribution studies were performed both in normal and tumor-bearing mice to evaluate the impact of the crosslinking on the in vivo behavior and on the tumor targeting performance. The distribution pattern was characterized by a low uptake in all organs except kidney, and rapid clearance from blood and normal tissue. Crosslinking of the protein resulted in a significantly increased tumor accumulation, rendering the tethered HER2-binding affibody molecule a valuable lead in the development of superior HER2 imaging agents.']\n",

Methods: An EGFR-specific Affibody molecule, ZEGFR:1907, and its dimeric form, (Z(EGFR:1907))(2), were labeled with In-111 using benzyl-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid and with I-125 using p-iodobenzoate.

Results: Head-to-tail dimerization of the Affibody molecule improved the dissociation rate. In vitro, dimeric forms demonstrated superior cellular retention of radioactivity. For both molecular set-ups, retention was better for the In-111-labeled tracer than for the radioiodinated counterpart. In vivo, all conjugates accumulated specifically in xenografts and in EGFRexpressing tissues. The retention of radioactivity in tumors was better in vivo for dimeric forms; however, the absolute uptake values were higher for monomeric tracers.

Targeting of antigens that are unique or more highly expressed in tumours than in normal tissues can be used to increase the specificity and reduce the cytotoxic effect on normal tissues. Several targeting agents have been studied for clinical use, where monoclonal antibodies have been the ones most widely used. More than 20 monoclonal antibodies are approved for therapy today and the largest field is oncology. Advances in genetic engineering and in vitro selection technology has enabled the feasible high-throughput generation of monoclonal antibodies, antibody derivatives [e.g. scFvs, Fab molecules, dAbs (single-domain antibodies), diabodies and minibodies] and more recently also non-immunoglobulin scaffold proteins. Several of these affinity proteins have been investigated for both in vivo diagnostics and therapy. Affinity proteins in tumour-targeted therapy can affect tumour progression by altering signal transduction or by delivering a payload of toxin, drug or radionuclide. The ErbB receptor family has been extensively studied as biomarkers in tumour targeting, primarily for therapy using monoclonal antibodies. Two receptors in the ErbB family, EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) and HER2 (epidermal growth factor receptor 2), are over-expressed in various malignancies and associated with poor patient prognosis and are therefore interesting targets for solid turnours. In the present review, strategies are described for tumour targeting of solid turnours using affinity proteins to deliver radionuclides, either for molecular imaging or radiotherapy. Antibodies, antibody derivatives and non-immunoglobulin scaffold proteins are discussed with a certain focus on the affibody (Affibody (R)) molecule.']\n",

Tc-99m as a label offers advantages in clinical practice, and earlier studies demonstrated that Tc-99m-labeled recombinant Affibody molecules with a C-terminal cysteine could be used for HER2 imaging.

The formation rate of ZnO and the overall corrosion rate of zinc increase in the order formic &lt; acetic &lt; propionic acid and are mainly attributed to the expected pH of the aqueous adlayer. The corrosion rates deduced are at least 1 order of magnitude higher than the experimentally determined field data due to a higher organic acid concentration used herein (120 ppb) and a higher average relative humidity (90%).']\n",

      "['A novel approach to evaluate the bending elasticity of monolayers formed by nonionic surfactants with a rigid head group is introduced by means of considering head group repulsion as derived from the free energy of mixing rigid hydrophilic head groups with surrounding solvent molecules as well as contributions related to the hydrophobic tails. Explicit expressions for the spontaneous curvature (H-0), bending rigidity (k(c)) and saddle-splay constant ((k) over bar (c)) have been derived for the constraint of constant chemical potential of free surfactant (thermodynamically open layers) as well as the constraint of constant aggregation number (thermodynamically closed layers). Most interestingly, it is demonstrated that k(c) for thermodynamically open layers formed by a nonionic surfactant with rigid tail and head group always must be zero. However, k(c) for surfactants with a flexible tail as a function of the head group-to-tail volume ratio is found to go through a maximum at some large, positive value of k(c) and H-0 approximate to 0. Eventually, k(c) falls below zero as the head group volume increases above a certain value. Hence, we may conclude that nonionic surfactants with a rigid head group may form thermodynamically stable fluid layers or aggregates only insofar the hydrophobic part is flexible with respect to chain conformational. degrees of freedom and the head group is not too voluminous.

Apparent micelle molar masses obtained with SLS were analyzed with a model taking into account both micelle growth and interference effects. The analysis shows that pure C(12)G(2) forms small globular micelles whereas C12E6 and the mixtures form elongated micelles of much higher molar mass. The elongated micelles grow with increased concentration according to mean-field theory, and the masses are larger for increasing amounts of C12E6. To describe the SANS and SAXS data for C12E6 and the mixtures, it: was necessary to employ a model with coexisting spherical and spherocylindrical micelles. The SANS and SAXS data were fitted simultaneously using this model with core-shell particles and molecular constraints. All mixtures, as well as pure C12E6, can be described by this model, demonstrating the coexistence of spherical and cylindrical micelles. The spherical micelles are the same size in all samples, whereas the cylindrical micelles grow in length with the fraction of C12E6 in the samples, as well as with concentration, in agreement with the SLS analysis. The mass fraction of surfactant in cylindrical aggregates also increases with the fraction of C12E6 and with overall concentration. The analysis of the SAXS and SANS data for pure C(12)G(2) shows that the micelles are disk-shaped. The presence of elongated micelles in pure C12E6 and in the mixtures demonstrates that the behavior of the mixtures is dominated by C12E6.']\n",

The surfactant binding isotherms were determined by the potentiometric method in the presence of 0.1 M sodium bromide. It was found that due to the grafting of the PEO chains to a polymer backbone the surfactant binding becomes significantly suppressed. The amount of bound surfactant at the critical micelle concentration (cmc) decreases almost 2 orders of magnitude compared to the binding on a linear PEO having a similar molecular weight. The binding of the surfactant was found to occur in cooperative fashion, though the critical aggregation concentration (cac) of the binding was found surprisingly small. This result was interpreted in terms of the surfactant aggregation numbers that were found much smaller in the case of the bottle brush polymers than in the case of linear PEOs due to the steric crowding of the grafted PEO chains. To confirm the results of the binding isotherm measurements, steady-state fluorescence probe (pyrene) measurements as well as static and dynamic light scattering measurements were performed.']\n",

It is demonstrated that the PB theory generates significantly better agreement with experimental data than predicted by ideal behaviour or the regular mixture theory. We find that maximum synergistic effects occur at a DDAB mole fraction in solution y = 0.005. According to the PB theory, this very low value of y corresponds to a mole fraction of DDAB in the self-assembled interfacial aggregates equal to x = 0.995. Moreover, our calculations of the surfactant composition in the self-assembled interfacial aggregates above cmc demonstrate that the transition from small micelles to large bilayer aggregates is found to consistently occur at a mole fraction of DDAB equal to about x = 0.41-0.42, irrespective of the surfactant molar ratio in solution. Experimental observations strongly support the fact that concentrations of free surfactant, as well as the surfactant composition in the self-assembled interfacial aggregates, may be accurately calculated from the non-linear Poison-Boltzmann theory. On the other hand, a micelle-to-bilayer transition induced by changes in surfactant mole fraction in the self-assembled interfacial aggregates is consistent with neither ideal surfactant behaviour nor synergistic behaviour according to the regular mixture theory.']\n",

Small oblate spheroidal micelles formed by DTAB grow with respect to width and length to form mixed ellipsoidal tablet-shaped micelles as an increasing fraction of DDAB is admixed into the micelles. The growth behaviour of the micelles is rationalized from the general micelle model in terms of three bending elasticity constants spontaneous curvature (H(0)), bending rigidity (k(c)) and saddle-splay constant ((k(c)) over bar kc). It is found that micelles grow with respect to width, mainly as a result of decreasing k(c)H(0), and in the length direction as a result of decreasing k(c). The micelles are still rather small, i.e. about 140 angstrom in length, as an abrupt transition to large bilayer aggregates is observed. The micelle-to-bilayer transition is induced by changes in aggregate composition and is observed to occur at a mole fraction of DDAB equal to about x = 0.48 in D(2)O, which is a significantly higher value than previously observed for the same system in H(2)O (x = 0.41).

As a result, our present investigation suggests a never before reported structural behavior of Gemini surfactant micelles, according to which micelles transform from elongated ellipsoids to nonelongated oblate spheroids as the length of the spacer group is increased. The aggregation number of oblate micelles is observed to monotonously decrease with an increasing length of the surfactant spacer group, mainly as a result of a decreasing minor half axis (a), whereas the major half axis (b) is rather constant with respect to s. We argue that geometrically heterogeneous elongated micelles are formed by dimeric surfactants with a short spacer group mainly as a result of the surface charges becoming less uniformly distributed over the micelle interface. As the length of the spacer group increases, the distance between intramolecular charges become approximately equal to the average distance between charges on the micelle interface, and as a result, rather small oblate spheroidal micelles with a more uniform distribution of surface charges are formed by dimeric 12-s-12 surfactants with 6 &lt;= s &lt;= 12.']\n",

These analyses represent landform entities with ground distances from 450 to 4950 m, which are local to regional features. The four morphometric parameters were used as input for the SOM algorithm. Forty-two SOMs with different learning parameter sets, e.g. initial radius, final radius and number of iterations were investigated.

      "[\"The maximum entropy (MaxEnt) principle is a versatile tool for statistical inference of the probability density function (pdf) from its moments as a least-biased estimation among all other possible pdfs. It maximizes Shannon entropy, satisfying the moment constraints. Thus, the MaxEnt algorithm transforms the original constrained optimization problem to the unconstrained dual optimization problem using Lagrangian multipliers. The Classic Moment Problem (CMP) uses algebraic power moments, causing typical conventional numerical methods to fail for higher-order moments (m &gt; 5-10) due to different sensitivities of Lagrangian multipliers and unbalanced nonlinearities. Classic MaxEnt algorithms overcome these difficulties by using orthogonal polynomials, which enable roughly the same sensitivity for all Lagrangian multipliers. In this paper, we employ an idea based on different principles, using Fup(n) basis functions with compact support, which can exactly describe algebraic polynomials, but only if the Fup order-n is greater than or equal to the polynomial's order. Our algorithm solves the CMP with respect to the moments of only low order Fup(2) basis functions, finding a Fup(2) optimal pdf with better balanced Lagrangian multipliers. The algorithm is numerically very efficient due to localized properties of Fup(2) basis functions implying a weaker dependence between Lagrangian multipliers and faster convergence. Only consequences are an iterative scheme of the algorithm where power moments are a sum of Fup(2) and residual moments and an inexact entropy upper bound. However, due to small residual moments, the algorithm converges very quickly as demonstrated on two continuous pdf examples - the beta distribution and a bi-modal pdf, and two discontinuous pdf examples - the step and double Dirac pdf. Finally, these pdf examples present that Fup MaxEnt algorithm yields smaller entropy value than classic MaxEnt algorithm, but differences are very small for all practical engineering purposes.\"]\n",

Wafer-scale integration of a cold-state deformation mechanism is provided by the deposition of stressed films onto the SMA sheet. A concept for heating of the SMA by Joule heating through a resistive heater layer is presented. Critical fabrication issues were investigated, including the cold-state deformation, the bonding scheme and related stresses, and the titanium-nickel (TiNi) sheet patterning. Novel methods for the transfer stamping of adhesive and for the handling of the thin TiNi sheets were developed, based on the use of standard dicing blue tape. First demonstrator TiNi cantilevers, wafer-level adhesively bonded on a microstructured silicon substrate, were successfully fabricated and evaluated. Intrinsically stressed silicon dioxide and silicon nitride were deposited using plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition to deform the cantilevers in the cold state. Tip deflections for 2.5-mm-long cantilevers in cold/hot state of 250/70 and 125/28 mu m were obtained using silicon dioxide and silicon nitride, respectively. The bond strength proved to be stronger than the force created by the 2.5-mm-long TiNi cantilever and showed no degradation after more than 700 temperature cycles. The shape-memory behavior of the TiNi is maintained during the integration process.']\n",

In addition to reducing self-heating effects, the thin Virtual substrates provide further improvements to gate oxide integrity, reliability and lifetime compared with conventional thick virtual substrates.

Good agreement between experimental data and physical models is demonstrated, enabling gate leakage mechanisms to be identified.

The general theory is applied to fullerene C-60 because of its good optical limiting properties, namely, a rather low ground state absorption and a strong triplet-triplet absorption. It is shown that sequential absorption involving strong triplet-triplet transitions is the major mechanism of nonlinear absorption. The intrinsic hierarchy of time scales makes an adiabatic solution of the coupled rate equations valid, which therefore can be reduced to a single dynamical equation for the ground state population. The slow evolution of this population is defined by an effective rate of population transfer to the triplet state and by the pulse duration. The propagation effect plays an important role in the optical power limiting performance. The intensity of the field as well as the population of the triplet state decreases during the pulse propagation, and a weakened nonlinear sequential two-photon absorption is followed by a linear one-photon absorption which gradually becomes the dominating process. The competition between these qualitatively different processes depends on the field intensity, the length of the absorber, and the concentration. The pulse propagation is studied by solving numerically the two-dimensional paraxial field equation together with the effective rate equation for the ground state population.']\n",

Possible existence of knotted solitons in multicomponent superconductors was predicted several years ago. However, their basic properties and stability in these systems remain an outstandingly difficult question both for analytical and numerical treatment. Here I propose a special perturbative approach to treat self-consistently all the degrees of freedom in the problem. I show that there exists a length scale for a Hopfion texture where the electrodynamics of a two-component superconductor is dominated by a self-induced Faddeev term, which is in stark contrast to the Meissner electrodynamics of single-component systems. I also show that at certain short length scales knotted solitons in the two-component Ginzburg-Landau model are not described by a Faddeev-Skyrme-type model and are unstable. However, these solitons can be stable at some intermediate length scales. I argue that configurations with high topological charge may be more stable in these systems than low-charge configurations. In the second part of the paper I discuss qualitatively different physics of the stability of knotted solitons in a more general Ginzburg-Landau model and point out the physically relevant terms which enhance or suppress the stability of knotted solitons. With this argument it is demonstrated that Ginzburg-Landau models possess stable knotted solitons.']\n",

Two cases with start of rolling from stationary contact were investigated, with constant and with linearly increasing applied slip. At each instant during the transition stage, it was assumed that the traction distribution could be approximated with the Carter traction for steady-state tractive rolling. Based on this distribution, approximate expressions were derived for the transient rolling distance and transient behaviour of the tangential load. The transient period could end in gross sliding or steady-state creep with the Carter traction distribution and stick-slip regions in the contact. The expressions and the transient traction distributions were validated numerically using FEM. Simulations with constant applied slip showed that when rolling started from a tangentially unloaded and unstrained position, the steady-state traction distribution by Carter was a good approximation of the actual transient traction distribution. The solution was accurate for transient rolling lengths longer than a quarter of the contact width. The transient behaviour depended on the bulk geometry of the structures. For the relatively stiff structure with two elastic steel cylinders, small amounts of relative slip and high coefficients of friction, the transient rolling distance, L-0, could become large. In the present study, examples with L-0 approximate to 40 . a were identified. Thus, situations exist for which the transient conditions might be important. The transient distance increased with smaller slip, larger coefficient of friction, lower bulk stiffness, higher contact normal loads and for more compliant materials.

However, presence of liquid water in a snowpack is known to decrease the radar wave velocity, which for a typical snowpack with 5% (by volume) liquid water can lead to an overestimation of SWE by about 20%. It would therefore be beneficial if radar measurements could also be used to determine snow wetness. Our approach is to use radar wave attenuation in the snowpack, which depends on electrical properties of snow (permittivity and conductivity) which in turn depend on snow wetness. The relationship between radar wave attenuation and these electrical properties can be derived theoretically, while the relationship between electrical permittivity and snow wetness follows a known empirical formula, which also includes snow density. Snow wetness can therefore be determined from radar wave attenuation if the relationship between electrical conductivity and snow wetness is also known. In a laboratory test, three sets of measurements were made on initially dry 1m thick snowpacks.

Under certain circumstances the operating point of the power system may start drifting towards the set of voltage unstable operating points. If no preventive measures are taken, after some time the operating point may eventually become voltage unstable. It will thus be preferable to have a measure of the risk of voltage collapse in future loading states. This paper presents a novel method for estimation of the probability distribution of the time to voltage instability for a power system with uncertain future loading scenarios. The method uses a distance from the predicted load-path to the set of voltage unstable operating points when finding an estimate of the time to voltage instability.

Deployment and stabilization of large space webs by spin have gained interest because the rotational inertia forces are in the plane of rotation and the spin rate that determines the magnitude of the web tension can be chosen to meet the mission requirements. Nevertheless, a robust control method is required for a successful spin deployment. The control law used for the deployment of the Znamya-2 membrane reflector, for which a feedback-controlled torque is applied to the center hub, was applied here to a quadratic space web folded in arms coiled around the hub.

This is also a source of broadband-conducted and radiated electromagnetic interference (EMI) for vehicle as well as traction power and signaling systems. In this paper and the companion paper, experimental analyses of pantograph arcing phenomena are presented for dc and ac feeding systems, respectively. Influences of different parameters on dc traction system, such as supply-voltage polarity, relative motion between pantograph and overhead contact wire, namely, forward motion along the track (longitudinal), and lateral sliding motion of the pantograph (zigzag) are presented here. From the voltage and current waveforms of the test runs, it is shown that pantograph arcing is a polarity-dependent phenomenon. For the positive-fed overhead traction system, where pantograph is cathode, the supply interruptions due to zigzag motion are comparatively less compared to negatively fed traction systems. As a result, the transients, due to pantograph arcing, are more frequent in negatively fed traction systems. It is found that the arc root movement along the electrode surfaces (pantograph-contact wire) is governed by the relative motion and polarity of the electrodes. The analyses presented in this paper also form a foundation to understand the pantograph arcing process and the corresponding influential parameters with the ac supply presented in the companion paper.

Influences of various parameters and test conditions on arcing phenomenon and their signature patterns on the supply voltage and current waveforms are presented. It is shown how the arcing mechanism and corresponding asymmetry in the voltage and current waveforms are governed by line speed, current, supply voltage, inductive load, and pantograph material. The asymmetry in the current waveform is mainly due to the difference in the duration of successive zero-current regions and uneven distortion of the waveshapes. This, in turn, creates the asymmetry in the voltage waveform.

Plasminogen activator, a serine protease that regulates blood coagulation, is known to be expressed in the saliva of Desmodus rotundus (common vampire bat) and is thought to be a key enzyme for the emergence of blood feeding in vampire bats. To better understand the evolution of this biological function, we studied the plasminogen activator (PA) genes from all vampire bat species in light of their feeding transition to bird and subsequently mammalian blood. We include the rare species Diphylla ecaudata and Diaemus youngi, where plasminogen activator had not previously been studied and demonstrate that PA gene duplication observed in Desmodus is not essential to the vampire phenotype, but relates to the emergence of predominant mammalian blood feeding in this species. Plasminogen activator has evolved through gene duplication, domain loss, and sequence evolution leading to change in fibrin-specificity and susceptibility to plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. Before undertaking this study, only the four plasminogen activator isoforms from Desmodus were known.

In vitro analyses demonstrated that XXXG-beta-Res is hydrolyzed by the archetypal plant XEH, nasturtium (Tropaeolum majus) NXG1, with classical Michaelis-Menten substrate saturation kinetics and a linear dependence on both enzyme concentration and incubation time. Further, XEH activity could be visualized in real time by observing the localized increase in fluorescence in germinating nasturtium seeds and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) inflorescent stems by confocal microscopy. Importantly, this new in situ XEH assay provides an essential complement to the in situ xyloglucan endotransglycosylase assay, thus allowing delineation of the disparate activities encoded by xyloglucan endotransglycosylase/hydrolase genes directly in plant tissues.

Initially, the mathematical model predictions of the drain sink formation height were compared with data from physical modeling, representing a situation with a low interfacial energy. The agreement was found to be good. Thereafter, mathematical modeling was done to evaluate the drain sink formation height at higher interfacial energies. In addition, an analytical expression was derived for the prediction of the drain sink formation height. The calculations using this equation were found to align well with both the experimental data as well as the numerical predictions. This analytical equation is suitable to use for determination of the drain sink formation height as function of the liquid/gas interfacial energy, liquid density, outlet radius and outlet length. In order to demonstrate its industrial usefulness the equation was used to predict drain sink formation heights for steel in a system with geometrical dimensions relevant for steel production. It was found that an increased interfacial energy lowered the drain sink formation height severely for small outlets, low-density fluids and short outlet lengths. In real plant practice, the predictions with the analytical equation yield that the effect of steel/argon interfacial energy decreases the predicted drain sink formation height by approximately 10% compared to if the interfacial energy was neglected.']\n",

On the other hand, labeling of immune cells serves as an ideal tool for visualization, diagnosis or treatment of inflammatory processes, which requires the efficient internalization of the nanoparticles into the cells of interest. Here, we compare novel monodispersed silica-coated iron oxide nanoparticles with commercially available dextran-coated iron oxide nanoparticles. The silica-coated iron oxide nanoparticles displayed excellent magnetic properties. Furthermore, they were nontoxic to primary human monocyte-derived macrophages at all doses tested whereas dose-dependent toxicity of the smaller silica-coated nanoparticles (30 nm and 50 nm) was observed for primary monocyte-derived dendritic cells, but not for the similarly small dextran-coated iron oxide nanoparticles. No macrophage or dendritic cell secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines was observed upon administration of nanoparticles. The silica-coated iron oxide nanoparticles were taken up to a significantly higher degree when compared to the dextran-coated nanoparticles, irrespective of size.

Deep water pools in the cavity are used in Nordic BWRs as an accident management measure aiming at particulate debris formation and coolability. It has been elaborated in the joint work of the European Severe Accident Research Network (SARNET) in Work Package (WP) 11.1 that coolability of particulate debris, reflooding of hot debris as well as boil-off under decay heat (long-term coolability), is strongly favoured by 2D/3D effects in beds with non-homogeneous structure and shape. Especially, water inflow from the sides and via bottom regions strongly improves coolability as compared to 1D situations with top flooding, the latter being in the past the basis of analyses on coolability. Data from experiments included in the SARNET network (DEBRIS at IKE and STYX at VTT) and earlier ones (e.g. POMECO at KTH) have been used to validate key constitutive laws in 2D codes as WABE (IKE) and ICARE/CATHARE (IRSN), especially concerning flow friction and heat transfer. Major questions concern the need of the explicit use of interfacial friction to adequately treat the various flow situations in a unified approach, as well as the adequate characterization of realistic debris composed of irregularly shaped particles of different sizes. joint work has been supported by transfer of the WABE code to KTH and VTT. Concerning realistic debris, the formation from breakup of melt jets in water is investigated in the DEFOR experiments at KTH. Present results indicate that porosities in the debris might be much higher than previously assumed, which would strongly support attainment of coolability. Calculations have been performed with IKEJET/IKEMIX describing jet breakup, mixing and settling of resulting particles. Models about debris bed formation and porosity are developed at KTH. The codes have been applied to reactor conditions for analysing the potential for coolability in the different phases of a severe accident.

This concerns, in general, the understanding of a severe accident with core melting, its course, major critical phases and timing, and the influence of these processes on the accident progression as well as, in particular, the evaluation of in-vessel melt retention by external vessel flooding as an accident mitigation strategy. Previous studies were especially related to the in-vessel retention question and often just concentrated on the quasi-steady state behaviour of a large molten pool in the lower head, considered as a bounding configuration. However, non-feasibility of the in-vessel retention concept for high power density reactors and uncertainties e.g. due to layering effects even for low or medium power reactors, turns this to be insufficient. Rather, it is essential to consider the whole evolution of the accident, including e.g. formation and growth of the in-core melt pool, characteristics of corium arrival in the lower head, and molten pool behaviour after the debris re-melting. These phenomena have a strong impact on a potential termination of a severe accident. The general objective of the LIVE program at FZK is to study these phenomena resulting from core melting experimentally in large-scale 3D geometry and in supporting separate-effects tests, with emphasis on the transient behaviour. Up to now, several tests on molten pool behaviour have been performed within the LIVE experimental program with water and with non-eutectic melts (KNO3-NaNO3) as simulant fluids. The results of these experiments, performed in nearly adiabatic and in isothermal conditions, allow a direct comparison with findings obtained earlier in other experimental programs (SIMECO, ACOPO, BALI, etc.) and will be used for the assessment of the correlations derived for the molten pool behaviour. Complementary to other international programs with real corium melts, the results of the LIVE activities also provide data for a better understanding of in-core corium pool behaviour. The experimental results are being used for the development and validation of mechanistic models for the description of molten pool behaviour, In the present paper, a range of different models is used for post-test calculations and comparative analyses. This includes simplified, but fast running models implemented in the severe accident codes ASTEC and ATHLET-CD.

Nordic BWRs rely on reactor cavity flooding as a means for ex-vessel melt coolability and ultimate termination of the accident progression. However, different modes of vessel failure may result in different regimes of melt release from the vessel, which determine initial conditions for melt coolant interaction and eventually coolability of the debris bed. The goal of this study is to define if retention of decay-heated melt inside the reactor pressure vessel is possible and investigate modes of the vessel wall failure otherwise. The mode of failure is contingent upon the ultimate mechanical strength of the vessel structures under given mechanical and thermal loads and applied cooling measures. The influence of pool depth and respective transient thermal loads on the reactor vessel failure mode is studied with coupled thermo-mechanical creep analysis. Efficacy of control rod guide tube (CRGT) cooling and external vessel wall cooling as potential severe accident management measures is investigated. First, only CRGT cooling is considered in simulations revealing two different modes of vessel failure: (i) a 'ballooning' of the vessel bottom and (ii) a 'localized creep' concentrated within the vicinity of the top surface of the melt pool.

We consider a hypothetical scenario with stratified (metal layer atop) melt pool in the lower plenum. Effective Convectivity Model (ECM) and Phase-Change ECM (PECM) are developed for the modeling of molten metal layer heat transfer. The PECM model takes into account reduced convection heat transfer in mushy zone and compositional convection that enables simulations of noneutectic binary mixture solidification and melting. The ECM and PECM are (i) validated against relevant experiments for both eutectic and noneutectic mixtures and (ii) benchmarked against CFD-generated data including the local heat transfer characteristics. The PECM is then applied to the analysis of heat transfer in a stratified heterogeneous debris pool taking into account CRGT cooling. The PECM simulation results show apparent efficacy of the CRGT cooling which can be utilized as Severe Accident Management (SAM) measure to protect the vessel wall from focusing effect caused by metallic layer.']\n",

      "['The major aim of work in the SARNET2 European project on ex-vessel debris formation and coolability was to get an overall perspective on coolability of melt released from a failed reactor pressure vessel and falling into a water-filled cavity. Especially, accident management concepts for BWRs, dealing with deep water pools below the reactor vessel, are addressed, but also shallower pools in existing PWRs, with questions about partial cooling and time delay of molten corium concrete interaction. The subject can be divided into three main topics: (i) Debris bed formation by breakup of melt, (ii) Coolability of debris and (iii) Coupled treatment of the processes. Accompanied by joint collaborations of the partners, the performed work comprises theoretical, experimental and modelling activities. Theoretical work was done by KTH on the melt outflow conditions from a RPV and on the quantification of the probability of yielding a non-coolable ex-vessel bed by use of probabilistic assessment. IKE introduced a theoretical concept to improve debris bed coolability. A large amount of experimental work was done by partners (KTH, VTT, IKE) on the coolability of debris beds using different bed geometries, particles, heating methods and water feeds, yielding a valuable base for code validation. Modelling work was mainly done by IKE, IRSN, RSE and VTT concerning jet breakup and/or debris bed formation and cooling in 2D and 3D geometries. A benchmark for the DEFOR-A experiment of KTH was performed. Important progress was reached for several tasks and aspects and important insights are given, enabling to focus the view on possible key aspects of future activities.']\n",

In this investigation the material behavior is modeled using an advanced macroscopic constitutive description initially presented by Brandt and Nilsson [1]. This material model, like many other models describing powder compaction at higher densities, includes a large number of constitutive parameters and as a result, a complete material characterization is a difficult task to perform or at least requires a large number of different experiments. A remedy to this problem is to apply inverse modeling, i.e. optimization, for determination of relevant material properties from comparatively simple experiments. It is then of course important, in order to achieve high accuracy results from the optimization procedure, that the stress fields produced during the experiments involves high gradients of stress. Adhering to simple uniaxial die compaction experiments the main parameter that can be used in order to achieve such a feature is the geometry of the punch used for load application. In the present investigation a number of punch profiles are studied and it is found that a skewed punch geometry is the most appropriate one to be used for experimental die compaction aiming at a constitutive description of the powder material based on inverse modeling.

Furthermore, in this context quantitative relations, for the determination of residual stresses using sharp indentation, have been presented.

Powder aggregates consisting of up to approximately 10,000 particles and formed by two powder populations with known material strength and size ratios have been compacted both isostatically and uniaxially (die compaction). The particles were assumed constitutively to be perfectly plastic or rigid and as a result, local contacts between the particles were described by a linear force-displacement relation given by previous in-depth analyses of spherical indentation problems. Particular emphasis has been placed on investigating the particle contact evolution at die compaction and to compare the results with previous ones pertinent to the isostatic case. Consequently, the predictive capability of the fundamental assumptions frequently used in theoretical analyses of compaction problems is determined for a uniaxial situation. The main conclusion is that size ratio effects are substantial at die compaction and when such features are present, theoretical predictions overestimates the (average) number of contacts per particle.

Despite the studies undertaken by numerous local researchers, and the identification of proven treatment methods for the specific water conditions encountered, no technologies have been commercialized due to a current lack of funding and technical assistance. Emerging, low-cost technologies to mitigate the problem of arsenic in drinking water resources that are suitable for rural and urban areas lacking centralized water supplies have been evaluated. The technologies generally use simple and low-cost equipment that can easily be handled and maintained by the local population. Experiences comprise (i) coagulation/filtration with iron and aluminum salts, scaled-down for small community-and household-scale-applications, (ii) adsorption techniques using low-cost arsenic sorbents, such as geological materials (clays, laterites, soils, limestones), natural organic-based sorbents (natural biomass), and synthetic materials. TiO2-heterogeneous photocatalysis and zerovalent iron, especially using nanoscale particles, appear to be promising emergent technologies.

The effects of temperature, blood and, wherever data are available, of the dimension of the microbubbles on P-thr are also considered. The large shelf thickness notwithstanding, the results of this investigation show that at room temperature, PVA contrast agents fracture at negative peak pressure values within the recommended safety limit. Furthermore, P-thr decreases with increasing temperature, radius of the microbubbles and number of cycles of the incident wave.

The effect of blood on P-thr varies according to condition under which the microbubbles have been synthesized, although stiffening of the shell is observed in most cases.

Taking into account only the formation energies yields a complete phase separation, strongly overestimating the two-phase region. The formation energies are calculated to be lower for the austenite than for the ferrite, meaning that the configurational entropy has a more significant impact on the stability field of the austenitic phase. The magnetic and vibrational free energies have opposite effects on the phase stability. Namely, the magnetic entropy favors the ferrite phase, whereas the vibrational free energy stabilizes the austenite phase.

To achieve this goal, we design a model of reaction systems where network modularity can be controlled and measure how well the reduction to simple graphs captures the modular structure of the model reaction system.

Furthermore, we argue that the proposed model for reaction systems with tunable clustering is a general framework for studies of how reaction systems are affected by modularity.

In fiber lasers however, while the efficiency  is increased, a reduced reabsorption in combination with reduced  homogeneous broadening tends to broaden the linewidth, yielding a low  spectral power density of the laser emission. In this work we lock a  cryogenically-cooled Yb-doped fiber laser with a volume Bragg grating to  overcome this problem and achieve a temporally stable narrow linewidth  highly efficient laser. We extract 11.4-W of output power in spectral  window of less than 0.4-nm with 14.5-W of launched pump light.']\n",

Based on these requirements we demonstrate a singly-resonant type-I OPO including periodically poled KTiOPO<sub>4</sub> and volume-Bragg gratings as output couplers. Singly resonant oscillation is demonstrated very close to degeneracy, where signal and idler spectra are not well separated. Investigations of the longitudinal mode spectrum and the idler spectrum with high resolution using a scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer show the essential role played by the phase correlations of the multi-longitudinal mode Q-switched pump laser in formation of the nonresonant idler spectrum.']\n",

A Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) is used to get a multi-wavelength source out of a single laser diode. The free spectral range and spectral response of the microwave photonic filter is tuned and reconfigured by controlling the microwave signal and the bias voltage applied on the MZM. Experimental results show the enhanced flexibility of the present microwave photonic filter.']\n",

The results show a fast response (&lt; 200 fs) and a nonlinear refractive index varying from 1.5 to 3.5x10(-15) cm(2)/W, depending upon glass composition. At the peak power level employed, nonlinear absorption was negligible.

In the experiment, a maximum pulse advancement of 130 ps with low distortion is achieved for a 1-ns signal pulse in a 10-mu m-radius silicon ring resonator.

      "Owing to unique morphology, ultrasmall lateral sizes, and exceptional properties, graphene quantum dots (GQDs) hold great potential in many applications, especially in the field of electrochemical biosensors, bioimaging, drug delivery, et cetera. Its biosafety and potential cytotoxicity to human and animal cells has been a growing concern in recent years. In this work, the potential cytotoxicity of GQDs was evaluated by molecular dynamics simulations. Our simulation demonstrates that small size GQDs could easily permeate into the lipid membrane in a vertical way. It is relatively difficult to permeate into the lipid membrane for GQDs that are larger than GQD61 on the nanosecond time-scale. The thickness of the POPC membrane could even be affected by the small size of GQDs. Free energy calculations revealed that the free energy barrier of GQD permeation through the lipid membrane could greatly change with the change of GQD size. Under high GQD concentration, the GQD molecules could rapidly aggregate in water but disaggregate after entering into the membrane interior. Moreover, high concentrations of GQDs could induce changes in the structure properties and diffusion properties of the lipid bilayer, and it may affect the cell signal transduction. However, GQDs with relatively small size are not large enough to mechanically damage the lipid membrane. Our results suggest that the cytotoxicity of GQDs with small size is low and may be appropriate for biomedical application.\n"

      "Mammalian cell lines are characterized by a complex and flexible metabolism. A single model that could describe the variations in metabolic behavior triggered by variations in the culture conditions would be a precious tool in bioprocess development. In this paper, we introduce an approach to generate a poly-pathway model and use it to simulate diverse metabolic states triggered in response to removal, reduction or doubling of amino acids in the culture medium of an antibody-producing CHO cell line. Macro-reactions were obtained from a metabolic network via elementary flux mode enumeration and the fluxes were modeled by kinetic equations with saturation and inhibition effects from external medium components. Importantly, one set of kinetic parameters was estimated using experimental data of the multiple metabolic states. A good fit between the model and the data was obtained for the majority of the metabolites and the experimentally observed flux variations. We find that the poly-pathway modeling approach is promising for the simulation of multiple metabolic states.\n",

      "Biological functions at the cellular level result from interactions between genes, proteins and metabolites within complex biochemical reaction networks. Identifying specific and localized fragilities in such networks is important to understand the source of biological malfunctions, and to devise strategies for fighting disease states that have developed robustness. Herein we consider a method based on robust control theoretic concepts for identifying network fragilities. In particular, we consider adding static or dynamic perturbations to the network edges, i.e. the direct binary interactions within the network, and compute the smallest perturbation that induces a bifurcation, and hence a qualitative change, in the network function. The proposed method can also serve as a powerful modeling tool in that it can be used to identify parts of a model that require more detailed descriptions of the underlying processes. The method is demonstrated by application to models of sustained oscillations in the glycolytic pathway and bistability in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction.\n",

      "Motivation: Multimillion-probe microarrays allow detection of gains and losses of chromosomal material at unprecedented resolution. However, the data generated by these arrays are several-fold larger than data from earlier platforms, creating a need for efficient analysis tools that scale robustly with data size. </p><p>Results: We developed a new aberration caller, Ultrasome, that delineates genomic changes-of-interest with dramatically improved efficiency. Ultrasome shows near-linear computational complexity and processes latest generation copy number arrays about 10 000 times faster than standard methods with preserved analytic accuracy.\n",

      "Biological functions have evolved to become robust against a multitude of perturbations such as gene mutations, intracellular noise and changes in the physical and chemical environment. This robustness should be reflected in models of the underlying biochemical networks, and robustness analysis has consequently been established as an important tool for model validation in systems biology. However, while robustness analysis can be used to invalidate a given model, it does not support the postulation of model modifications that can serve to improve the robustness. Herein we propose a method for this purpose, based on computing the sensitivity of the robustness with respect to generic dynamic perturbations applied to the individual network edges. To quantify robustness we compute the smallest simultaneous change in the activity of the network nodes that induces a bifurcation in the network, resulting in a qualitative change in the network behavior. The proposed method can be used to identify network interactions with the most significant impact on the overall robustness of a given function. By considering the impact of adding new nodes and edges, the method can also be used to postulate the presence of important unmodeled components and interactions. The focus here is on biological functions related to bistable switches and sustained oscillations, and the proposed methodology is demonstrated through application to metabolic oscillations in white blood cells and bistable switching in MAPK signal transduction. The classical Goodwin model of oscillations in a simple gene regulatory network is used for illustration throughout the paper.\n",

      "Analysis of gene expression data sets reveals that the variation in expression is concentrated to significantly fewer 'characteristic modes' or 'eigengenes' than the number of both recorded assays and measured genes. Previous works have stressed the importance of these characteristic modes, but neglected the equally important weak modes. Herein a generic system property - interampatteness - is defined that explains the previous feature, and assigns equal weight to the characteristic and weak modes. An interampatte network is characterised by strong INTERactions enabling simultaneous AMPlification and ATTEnuation of different signals. It is postulated that biochemical networks are interampatte, based on published experimental data and theoretical considerations. Existence of multiple time-scales and feedback loops is shown to increase the degree of interampatteness. Interampatteness has strong implications for the dynamics and reverse engineering of the network. One consequence is highly correlated changes in gene expression in response to external perturbations, even in the absence of common transcription factors, implying that interampatte gene regulatory networks erroneously may be assumed to have co-expressed/ co-regulated genes. Data compression or reduction of the system dimensionality using clustering, singular value decomposition, principal component analysis or some other data mining technique results in a loss of information that will obstruct reconstruction of the underlying network.\n",

      "Recent advances in both anthropomorphic robots and bimanual industrial manipulators had led to an increased interest in the specific problems pertaining to dual arm manipulation. For the future, we foresee robots performing human-like tasks in both domestic and industrial settings. It is therefore natural to study specifics of dual arm manipulation in humans and methods for using the resulting knowledge in robot control. The related scientific problems range from low-level control to high level task planning and execution. This review aims to summarize the current state of the art from the heterogenous range of fields that study the different aspects of these problems specifically in dual arm manipulation.\n",

      "Glucose homeostasis is the result of complex interactions across different biological levels. This multilevel characteristic should be considered when analyzing and designing closed-loop glucose control algorithms. Classic control schemes use only a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) perspective to describe the gluco-regulatory system. A multilevel model combining a PKPD model with an insulin signaling model is proposed for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus T1DM (T1DM). The PKPD Dalla Man model for T1DM is expanded to include an intracellular level involving insulin signaling to control glucose uptake through glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) translocation. A model-based controller is then designed and used as an example to illustrate the feasibility of the proposal. Two significant results were obtained for the controller explicitly utilizing multilevel information. No hypo-glycemic events were registered and an excellent performance for interpatient variability was achieved. Controller performance was evaluated using two indexes. The glucose was kept inside the range (70-180) mg/dl more than 99% of the time, and the intrapatient variability measured using control variability grid analysis was solid with 90% of the population inside the target zone. Multilevel models open new possibilities for designing glucose control algorithms. They allow controllers to take into account variables that have a strong influence on glucose homeostasis. A model-based controller was used for demonstrating how improved knowledge of the multilevel nature of diabetes increases the robustness and performance of glucose control algorithms. Using the proposed multi-level approach, a reduction of the hypoglycemic risk and robust behaviour for intrapatient variability was demonstrated.\n",

      "DNA copy number aberrations (CNAs) are a hallmark of cancer genomes. However, little is known about how such changes affect global gene expression. We develop a modeling framework, EPoC (Endogenous Perturbation analysis of Cancer), to (1) detect disease-driving CNAs and their effect on target mRNA expression, and to (2) stratify cancer patients into long-and short-term survivors. Our method constructs causal network models of gene expression by combining genome-wide DNA-and RNA-level data. Prognostic scores are obtained from a singular value decomposition of the networks. By applying EPoC to glioblastoma data from The Cancer Genome Atlas consortium, we demonstrate that the resulting network models contain known disease-relevant hub genes, reveal interesting candidate hubs, and uncover predictors of patient survival. Targeted validations in four glioblastoma cell lines support selected predictions, and implicate the p53-interacting protein Necdin in suppressing glioblastoma cell growth. We conclude that large-scale network modeling of the effects of CNAs on gene expression may provide insights into the biology of human cancer. Free software in MATLAB and R is provided.\n"
